And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.

First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie. As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations. I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game. ================================================================== Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!! I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?! Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense! You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory! The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO. Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.</td><td>Skip!</td><td>1357776000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-01-10</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>A2GPRA9HHLOC4B</td><td>0700026398</td><td>Wicasawakan</td><td>I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment). PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced. I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.

Lew</td><td>I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.</td><td>Dirt, Dirt 2, and Dirt 3</td><td>1354752000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-12-06</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AQTC623NCESZW</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Chesty Puller</td><td>I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is.

I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing. I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2. I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway. I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :) http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1341886844&sr=8-1&keywords=richard+burns+rally Thank you for reading my review!

You can now purchase your new car from the online store!!!\" OMG REALLY??? I CAN SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I ALREADY PAID FOR??? NO WAI!!!! But overall, if you don't mind playing with the same default cars all the time, it's a pretty fun game. I really only play online mode, which allows you to race against other people.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!</td><td>An overlooked gem in the Forza/GT treasure trove</td><td>1332115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-03-19</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>ANW6EGY12V5XS</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Henri Savin</td><td>I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with. I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it. Why they can't get their asses in gear (pun intended) and fix it I don't know, but with so many folks reporting the problem it isn't just occasional. I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.</td><td>Abysmal support from Codemasters</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-09-14</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>3.0</td><td>7</td><td>true</td><td>A1DLMTOTHQ4AST</td><td>0700099867</td><td>ampgreen</td><td>I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.</td><td>awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-09-14</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQQQ3IA92VBGR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Steven Rea</td><td>The metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it.

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.  Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.</td><td>Excellent reference material for the latest Zelda games</td><td>1390176000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-01-20</td></tr><tr><td>83</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3Q1EK4VBVHJCP</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Natalia Canela</td><td>amazing cool awesome interesting guides of the legend of Zelda excellent collectors edition item great for Zelda fans super cool</td><td>Great</td><td>1389744000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-01-15</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2DFT8S9UHSETY</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Christina</td><td>I already have all the Zelda Collectors edition guides but I decided to purchase this as well just to add to my collection.

The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.</td><td>So awesome, but why no guide for A Link Between Worlds?</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2AL1GN0TMTUXR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>ROB F.</td><td>this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!</td><td>LOZ is the best!</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>true</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.</td><td>A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans</td><td>1385510400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-27</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>4.0</td><td>55</td><td>true</td><td>A10PPCIFVK9ZT5</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Gary Coffman</td><td>I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already.

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have \"harmony\" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.  For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in.

It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the \"bottom\" of the device.

In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad.

This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game). If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time. You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game. It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then. I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all. If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2. These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running.</td><td>This is not as bad as others have said...</td><td>1329868800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-02-22</td></tr><tr><td>154</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3BHSG5R5NGKWK</td><td>8176503290</td><td>T.

In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble. The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own. Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.</td><td>OK for PS/PS2, useless for N64</td><td>1313107200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-08-12</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>AHO7BK8TE581B</td><td>8565000168</td><td>pzkfw</td><td>I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64. Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB. I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results. PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers) Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly. Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work. PS2 MadCatz Controller: Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller. Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test. N64: I had two controllers to test with it. Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly. Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly. Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats. Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.</td><td>Great concept but equally flawed game....</td><td>1218585600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-08-13</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3NIF89RBTYXZP</td><td>907843905X</td><td>The Plague Doctor</td><td>This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it.

My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller.

Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller. Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing. This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance. (One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.) Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2) Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person.

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times. The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was \"Stuntman Ignition\" (possibly \"Stuntman\" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.  The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.</td><td>Hardly Functions</td><td>1338422400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-05-31</td></tr><tr><td>310</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1GLFVY2JJNCIK</td><td>9629971372</td><td>THE_RED</td><td>Lo recib hace cuatro das y estoy super contento, funciona excelente, tanto la consola como la tarjeta de memoria.

One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear.

All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack. I'd recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV.  Their \"may\" be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games, but I couldn't beat the price.  I didn't bother even looking for an alternative.</td><td>Works great to extend gamecube controller cord</td><td>1364860800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-04-02</td></tr><tr><td>363</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A33RQCUQW7DS8N</td><td>9882155456</td><td>AntMont</td><td>These things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head.

The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game. Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked. Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. \"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it. It's definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the \"Myst\" era.</td><td>One of the best search and explore games</td><td>969148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-09-17</td></tr><tr><td>409</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1K0L2PKZLISWJ</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>P.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.</td><td>One of the best 2D fighters on the original Playstation</td><td>1080691200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-03-31</td></tr><tr><td>411</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>Zachary</td><td>Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom! Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version. Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade! Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS! Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\") 2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\") 3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.) 4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!) 5. Wolverine (The cheap one) 6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!) 7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\") 8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.) 9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.) 10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.) Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you.

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way. Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well. The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons. As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game</td><td>MegaMan: ocarina of final fantasy</td><td>1392854400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-20</td></tr><tr><td>423</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQ0IPFCF1UM92</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Kevin M.</td><td>Well as far as the person who sold this to me goes, the game came as described and in a well timed manner and I would shop here again.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.</td><td>My Favorite Game or All Time</td><td>1209859200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-05-04</td></tr><tr><td>432</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2GW1DBM406VU1</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Jarrett P.

I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless.

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.</td><td>Mega Man in 3D</td><td>1153094400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-17</td></tr><tr><td>436</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>AMZCQIDUWDHLC</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>John. N</td><td>To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding. Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark. Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids. The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here. So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter). The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series. In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.</td><td>A good game with lots of heart...</td><td>1118275200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-06-09</td></tr><tr><td>437</td><td>4.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>A2329GPAT2XIIZ</td><td>B000006P0M</td><td>Ultimate Reviewer</td><td>For the \"Ace combat\" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original \"Ace Combat\" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed \"Ace Combat\" too, in the beginning.

Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2... If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed. The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself. In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.</td><td>Take to the Skies</td><td>1205712000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-03-17</td></tr><tr><td>441</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JG09K1W72Q5</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Brandon</td><td>Most Teekns fans carer started with Tekken 3.

Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.

Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.

Jongeling</td><td>While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started. On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.</td><td>The building block of the Tekken series</td><td>1339200000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-06-09</td></tr><tr><td>445</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3PVGP99ZTBGV2</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Matthew Rickard</td><td>Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series.

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play.

He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.</td><td>Of dragons and boredom</td><td>965692800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-08</td></tr><tr><td>454</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OVX97R347HXC</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.</td><td>Just didn't meet my expectations.</td><td>964742400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-28</td></tr><tr><td>455</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GM5B6DK9KP22</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Junkhog</td><td>Perfect</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1464307200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-05-27</td></tr><tr><td>456</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A119Q9NFGVOEJZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Ivan Orozco</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's the best of the best capcom rocks all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 rocks breath of fire 5 is the greatest video game company in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 5 rocks,breath of fire 6 is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 6 rocks</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's</td><td>1437609600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-07-23</td></tr><tr><td>457</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A14IQPHOQ9LAYH</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Adam Hatton</td><td>haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright</td><td>awesome</td><td>1402704000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-06-14</td></tr><tr><td>458</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1296CMAKC79FZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Andrea W</td><td>Item arrived on time and as described.

Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.</td><td>It keeps getting better</td><td>1065225600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-10-04</td></tr><tr><td>464</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AACIKO4GH062J</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Eric C.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.

To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.

The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners.

The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.</td><td>Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game</td><td>982886400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-02-23</td></tr><tr><td>472</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A32GARQ84MVVYV</td><td>B000006P0K</td><td>Taylor Moore</td><td>Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about. Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games. For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes. The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling). Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME.

What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.</td><td>Butchered arcade to home conversion</td><td>1107129600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-01-31</td></tr><tr><td>497</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2GAP7XWBZU8QI</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Eric</td><td>I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.  I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.</td><td>What was Capcom thinking?</td><td>1069286400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-11-20</td></tr><tr><td>498</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.</td><td>This game is bad</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td></tr><tr><td>499</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2CKNSDDC5XOFG</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX \"greatest hits\" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.</td><td>Concept is good, but tedious game play really spoils the fun</td><td>999043200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-08-29</td></tr><tr><td>504</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AK00PWOR3BNAQ</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>MacArthur Davis</td><td>Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!!

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.</td><td>Begin The Treasure Hunt!</td><td>1391558400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-05</td></tr><tr><td>522</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A4Z9NHOW5LT0M</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>JoB</td><td>Tomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D? So I'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5.</td><td>Still great</td><td>1187568000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2007-08-20</td></tr><tr><td>530</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A33693RRRFK55Q</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>B. Erickson</td><td>OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden \"secrets,\" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous \"medi-paks.\" Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.</td><td>The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff</td><td>1100563200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-11-16</td></tr><tr><td>531</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1FD8LITJZE48V</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Frank Ponce</td><td>Ok, sounds perveted. It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy, adventurous, and alluring Lara Croft, but many other people do too. Anyway, this is it. The first \"Tomb Raider\" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all. It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every \"Tomb Raider\" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!

Convery</td><td>If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.

In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...</td><td>Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!</td><td>1031011200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-03</td></tr><tr><td>534</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway.

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.</td><td>An Outstanding Game Certainly to Become a Classic</td><td>1023580800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-09</td></tr><tr><td>536</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A2JVBNO9A6JAVV</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>C-N-G</td><td>Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time.

Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?

Jongeling</td><td>Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game. There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile. The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face. You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it. All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time.

They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world. Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz.

It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really \"snazzy\" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a \"Streets of Rage\" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:   Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.   Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5   Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)   Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.

In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.</td><td>The Best Game in an Outstanding Series</td><td>1024444800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-19</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AX8NRG579WOCV</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>N. Soucy</td><td>This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.  When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed. I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically. The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game. So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.  It's a blast, and I actually finished that game.</td><td>Too clunky for a modern gamer</td><td>1480550400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-12-01</td></tr><tr><td>555</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AH5OGQP0S9KSU</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Alan C.

It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best. The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end, and get every secret without any hints.  One of my top favorite five video games of all time.

These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual \"Tomb Raiding\" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game.

You'll never feel such joy until you play this. It's definitely different than the first. In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them. Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs. The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see... You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles. there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did. This game is still full of an lot of things, and quite frankly it still freaks me out to play.

I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. \"The Wall\" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc \"old and scratched up\" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.</td><td>Tomb Raider II</td><td>1275436800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-06-02</td></tr><tr><td>570</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2J55HYXQYGZXB</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>J.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.</td><td>Still holds up</td><td>1045526400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-02-18</td></tr><tr><td>574</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>A3HTX1NOTTWERP</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Busy Body</td><td>Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got! After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian. OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).</td><td>I need this and the second one</td><td>1150502400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-06-17</td></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Zachary</td><td>The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos. Lets go over it: 1st - classic with no supers lots of characters 2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters 3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.</td><td>One thing people are missing to consider about this game!</td><td>1072569600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-12-28</td></tr><tr><td>581</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name \"Street Fighter II\" is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a \"collection\" that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley. But fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting.</td><td>Good but not great</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td></tr><tr><td>582</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>A1LEN6BO4XR1DI</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Sean Shannon</td><td>Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.</td><td>Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired</td><td>986947200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-04-11</td></tr><tr><td>583</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JHJ48J9EZNMH</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Robert evans</td><td>This wwf game sucks...

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead</td><td>Boring Game!</td><td>1400716800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-05-22</td></tr><tr><td>586</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3TQTYD0D6AUO3</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Steve F</td><td>Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.</td><td>the absolute low point</td><td>1152748800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-13</td></tr><tr><td>588</td><td>4.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>AAQ75C4BJUQLO</td><td>B000009QCX</td><td>Sixto Limiac</td><td>Kartia: \"The Word Of Fate\" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!</td><td>RPGs, you gotta love em'</td><td>968457600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-09-09</td></tr><tr><td>589</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>AQ7OZH6CSCTY6</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days, so it's nice when a good one comes along. Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me. I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off. Overall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.</td><td>Very Fun Game</td><td>1366675200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-04-23</td></tr><tr><td>593</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A305MT5Y9I4T69</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Charles B Valentino</td><td>This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone. Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to \"buy\" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.

Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those \"other agents\" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.

Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the \"bad\" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer.

The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.</td><td>It's a good entertainment</td><td>966643200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-19</td></tr><tr><td>598</td><td>5.0</td><td>20</td><td>false</td><td>A3S87ZOPB3UM9N</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>atmj</td><td>As a fan of Myst and Riven, I would not put this game in the same  category.  However, it does equally well for it's type.  Myst and Riven  don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you  have a name and a face. The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore.  He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully.  As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining. I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot. The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up. All in all a good buy.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1. Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series. Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.</td><td>Twisted Metal Series Review</td><td>1386115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-12-04</td></tr><tr><td>622</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A22QYM5WUYSKHK</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>Travis Foster</td><td>Although I should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition I was not satisfied.

Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all.

This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that. The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore. In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.</td><td>good game</td><td>1062720000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-09-05</td></tr><tr><td>639</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OUKHGJ85XN4U</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Charles H.</td><td>I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played. Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire! Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions. Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots. Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect. Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is? It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.</td><td>The Force Is Strong In This Game</td><td>1344988800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-08-15</td></tr><tr><td>640</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JAICBAZ3YHF1</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>michael</td><td>star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you're not a star wars fan you won't regret it</td><td>star wars rogue squadron ROCKS</td><td>1301616000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-04-01</td></tr><tr><td>641</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV56CQTOGFTCJ</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Jake</td><td>This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed. I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system. That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it. As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high. But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well.

Jongeling</td><td>Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways. Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying. New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done. The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter. (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating. Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor* The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited. All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability. If you can find this cheap, get it.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.</td><td>Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64</td><td>1031788800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-12</td></tr><tr><td>660</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A3SF50Z5Q7PJA4</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Casey Aytes</td><td>Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine. The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \"Mission Complete\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied.</td><td>Not that loyal to the movie</td><td>1017273600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-03-28</td></tr><tr><td>661</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>AK3DY70GYZB2G</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Rex Marksmanson</td><td>If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing.  \"Rogue Squadron\" pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother).  The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.  Can't get you're hands on the new Rogue Squadron \"Rogue Leader\" for Gamecube?

After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold. The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth. As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while. The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them. It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.</td><td>I just love blasting TIE'S....</td><td>1006128000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-11-19</td></tr><tr><td>663</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EAONPHFORLH</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Joshua Swanson</td><td>This game is great for Star Wars fans!

The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals.

You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race).

First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64. 9/10</td><td>Finally; a great snowboarding game.</td><td>1144540800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-04-09</td></tr><tr><td>684</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A37QIM8W556IMQ</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Teresa A.

The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.   It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.   This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player.

The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.

My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the \"Black Diamond\" level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.

The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together. Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it. Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic. I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before. The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia. Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it. Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner. In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to \"Final Fantasy VII\", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: \"Final Fantasy VII\"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made!!!

I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do. Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.) Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun) Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING) Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version) Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do) Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game) Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.

The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development. FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle (Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on) FFII- wound-developable characters (Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.) FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills) FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin) FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it) FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills) FF7- basic weapon system FF8- GF system FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>1131148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-11-05</td></tr><tr><td>697</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24XAFHKD0NT28</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>cloud_mcaeris</td><td>FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world, in fact, it is my whole world.

Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it? Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have. Especially if you're already dead. That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?). Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years. Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client. And that's when he gets in over his head. The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake. Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.

The game centers around Manny Calavera who is attempting to stay honest and make sense out of a Hispanic day of the dead afterlife which has been corrupted by those who control that afterlife for their own gain. All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked. I've tried a lot of the adventure games and they all have their flaws. But Grim Fandango comes as close to perfect as any game ever will.

You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world. I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns. This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons?

It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be. But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller).

Blessen</td><td>Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter. Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies. The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating. The interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story. The  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.</td><td>Original and Literate</td><td>957571200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-06</td></tr><tr><td>742</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A233JF1T2IIBLT</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Genesis Whitmore</td><td>I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango.  An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did. Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday. Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango. The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another. The things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone, this would be it.</td><td>Probably the best adventure game ever made</td><td>957312000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-03</td></tr><tr><td>743</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A243HY69GIAHFI</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>tropic_of_criticism</td><td>Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution.  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games. True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout. If I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized. Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available. Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.</td><td>LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future</td><td>956880000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-04-28</td></tr><tr><td>744</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3N1V8LIFT0RU6</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...

It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really! Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game. The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives. Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters. A definite must have for all retro gamers and Bond fanatics alike.</td><td>A momentous release</td><td>1392076800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-11</td></tr><tr><td>808</td><td>5.0</td><td>13</td><td>true</td><td>A3NT5JXI3WUHA8</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>Tristan</td><td>Brings back memories of days long gone by.

It looked to childish, to easy, and just basically stupid.  Comming from the  epic company Rareware, I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about.  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.

The graphics were better and Lara had new moves.  But the game took an almost insane turn for hardness.  Not the best pick for your first Tomb Raider experience. The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?  Still a solid game and worth adding to your Playstation collection though.</td><td>Hard Turn in the Difficulty Department</td><td>1410480000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-09-12</td></tr><tr><td>812</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3HR16QI7S44QF</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>viti</td><td>Excellent item!</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1410480000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-09-12</td></tr><tr><td>813</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2W5BVUPEVX1ME</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Christian Tucholske</td><td>I have to admit, it's not as enjoyable (at least to me) as Tomb Raider 1 & 2. This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything. But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more. Brings back Eidos' weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the 90s full force (All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs, as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty. If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that. Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?) It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point. By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison. At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least. Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it. BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, \"Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery\" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.</td><td>Not difficult, impossible.

With its promotional montage, you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conker's game another cartoony adventure rather than the adult-oriented one they ended up making.  - Anyway the game is fantastic, a perfect supplement to Super Mario 64. In some ways it's actually better. When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats, to just have fun and explore. I played it enough times to 100% the game in two hours.

It only costs you $11.00 for the WII VC version, so do the math, fools! I've been a Zelda fan since the 1st Zelda on the NES, Shigeru Miyamoto is the greatest video game designer of all time, he should be in the Video Game Hall of Fame.

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me? The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at. Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels. Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!! Yippee. Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck! But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3. If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!</td><td>TOO HARD</td><td>1086998400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-06-12</td></tr><tr><td>834</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.

The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission. Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.

Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it. Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either. You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money. Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term. It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme. But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games. If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely. Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times. But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.</td><td>Lara's the One (on the Playstation)</td><td>966297600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-15</td></tr><tr><td>847</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV8PFPPTB6I5V</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Jared Phillips</td><td>One of if not the best game on the n64.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1475452800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-10-03</td></tr><tr><td>848</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A198I1P469E3L8</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>leif hudson</td><td>It's okay, but I still don't see why everyone talks about this game.

Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo.

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered. REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers. REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode. If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends.

I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches.

There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day.

Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5 Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/ Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5 Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers! A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play. Story: You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself. Gameplay: To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it. Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it. Controls: They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process. Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it. Music: *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part. Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P Oh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :( Replay Value: It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations. Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard). But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage. ______ If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Berk</td><td>GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release. This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer. The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience. (Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)</td><td>One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!</td><td>1238371200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2009-03-30</td></tr><tr><td>890</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series. One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too. The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust. While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game. Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness. The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there. The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration. The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time. Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies. The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot. If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence. Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting. Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die. Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be). Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!</td><td>a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star</td><td>1374796800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-07-26</td></tr><tr><td>891</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A36QIF5IIJ5EJX</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>K_Renny</td><td>One of the best games of all time.

This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game. What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil. Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure.

Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with \"slappers only.\" In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill. The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different. The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives). Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it.

Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter. The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun. Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life, but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare's wonderful game.

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems. The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it. There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby. The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there. Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000. If you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.</td><td>Same as the original</td><td>1108512000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-02-16</td></tr><tr><td>918</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EICDA6FL5VK</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Johnny B.

You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole.

It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent. There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die. Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill. Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening. The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away. This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.</td><td>Difficult</td><td>1120953600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-07-10</td></tr><tr><td>922</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AD0J5KK4WQXNS</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>OverTheMoon</td><td>Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5. ...............socks</td><td>Still a fun game...TS v RA2?</td><td>1013558400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-02-13</td></tr><tr><td>927</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AG5RAVN4WSXXJ</td><td>B00000DMA8</td><td>Crash999 a PC and XBox gamer</td><td>Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money.

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome.

It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"</td><td>banjo kapooie</td><td>1376265600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-08-12</td></tr><tr><td>937</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AJPTIO3SH82S7</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>brutusmuktuk</td><td>Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth. The Good: + A fun story + An imaginative use of its characters + Creative worlds to explore The Bad: -- Too easy and short -- The few parts that are too hard The Ugly ? Why is Kazooie so insulting? Story--9/10 The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself? Gameplay--8/10 Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all? There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing). These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable. Longevity--5/10 A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.</td><td>A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush</td><td>1371600000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-06-19</td></tr><tr><td>938</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>ASFAJ90S77BZH</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Granny Samples</td><td>OMGosh !! . .

I wasn't to familiar with the C&C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series. If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way! The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at!

Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base! That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks... THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were). ....

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee  aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i don't think so.  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is  about (no real actors - jus  bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games.  Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old C&C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they haven't been looking for, they disgrace the game.  We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if you're a  serious fan of C&C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have remembered.</td><td>Not a copycat of Red Alert; better than Starcraft</td><td>964224000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-22</td></tr><tr><td>948</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1E8F0AYFXPCRB</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Derrick</td><td>This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters.

The camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was 3D platforming in it's beginning and really, the camera is about as perfect as a 3D platforming camera can be. To summarize... Great gameplay. Awesome graphics for the time. An ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end. (A real bummer that the two games DIDN'T link after all). That's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N64. Otherwise....another great platformer from the golden age of platforming, collect a thons. Highly recommended.</td><td>One of the best platformers.</td><td>1294704000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-01-11</td></tr><tr><td>962</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A39GFCCXQ37J7V</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>TTT</td><td>CLASSIC!!!</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1478995200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-11-13</td></tr><tr><td>963</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2TIZCOP1KN2YA</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>I like this game.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1476403200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-10-14</td></tr><tr><td>964</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>A1T9PJBFBFKSGD</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Auburn Niewiadomski</td><td>Rare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games. Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review. First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay. In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected. There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver. I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman. I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality. What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.</td><td>Banjo Kazooie</td><td>1283212800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>965</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ANIOV3E6MR50R</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>jack harris</td><td>work as advertised.</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>1467936000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-08</td></tr><tr><td>966</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2TKKB683DPZXU</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Avidshopr83</td><td>Works but have to clean every time, love the game</td><td>love the</td><td>1467417600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-02</td></tr><tr><td>967</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24JQTKGA5RAKX</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>JoeAZ92</td><td>Positive: + gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time + worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content + music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots + sharp controls that work well for the most part Negative: - you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world - camera doesn't always give you the best view you need Super Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie. Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth. The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too. Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area. But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds. Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times. One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool. Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.

Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back. The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage. This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid.

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back. Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good. Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways. Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much.

Both are almost the same. If you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious, both are for you. Overall, since Banjo-Kazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzle-finding feature to it, I would suggest you pick up Banjo-Kazooie first and then either get Banjo-Tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game, or get Super Mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game. Also, Banjo-Kazooie is A LOT easier than Super Mario 64.

It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is.

Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation. I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody. The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic. The story goes... The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game. Well, I hope you enjoy this game.

It is the same as anno 1701 but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals.

And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.

First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie. As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations. I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game. ================================================================== Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!! I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?! Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense! You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory! The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO. Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.</td><td>Skip!</td><td>1357776000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-01-10</td><td>467</td><td>2582</td><td>0.022275958994708998</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>A2GPRA9HHLOC4B</td><td>0700026398</td><td>Wicasawakan</td><td>I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower. Don't waste your $ on the Pro Edition.</td><td>Great game with design flaws</td><td>1356480000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-12-26</td><td>545</td><td>2826</td><td>0.01724600728838018</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2LVV3GA8LN557</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Mike A.

I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment). PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced. I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.</td><td>Dirt, Dirt 2, and Dirt 3</td><td>1354752000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-12-06</td><td>491</td><td>2507</td><td>0.13902107812822098</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AQTC623NCESZW</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Chesty Puller</td><td>I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS.

I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.</td><td>Abysmal support from Codemasters</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-09-14</td><td>122</td><td>658</td><td>0.06749999999999998</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>3.0</td><td>7</td><td>true</td><td>A1DLMTOTHQ4AST</td><td>0700099867</td><td>ampgreen</td><td>I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.</td><td>awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-09-14</td><td>649</td><td>3492</td><td>0.007527056277056293</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQQQ3IA92VBGR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Steven Rea</td><td>The metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it.

I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.

The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.</td><td>So awesome, but why no guide for A Link Between Worlds?</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td><td>245</td><td>1334</td><td>0.1710335497835498</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2AL1GN0TMTUXR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>ROB F.</td><td>this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!</td><td>LOZ is the best!</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td><td>24</td><td>112</td><td>0.5035714285714287</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>true</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.</td><td>A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans</td><td>1385510400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-27</td><td>1082</td><td>5780</td><td>0.15944932648472473</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>4.0</td><td>55</td><td>true</td><td>A10PPCIFVK9ZT5</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Gary Coffman</td><td>I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already.

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have \"harmony\" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.

The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged. Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the \"bottom\" of the device. The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing. In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad.

In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble. The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own. Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.</td><td>OK for PS/PS2, useless for N64</td><td>1313107200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-08-12</td><td>199</td><td>1133</td><td>0.12078664799253035</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>AHO7BK8TE581B</td><td>8565000168</td><td>pzkfw</td><td>I was interested in this product for the n64 part.

Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB. I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results. PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers) Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly. Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work. PS2 MadCatz Controller: Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller. Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test. N64: I had two controllers to test with it. Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly. Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly. Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats. Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.</td><td>Great concept but equally flawed game....</td><td>1218585600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-08-13</td><td>544</td><td>2969</td><td>1.1630160883892396E-4</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3NIF89RBTYXZP</td><td>907843905X</td><td>The Plague Doctor</td><td>This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it.

Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller.

Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing. This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance. (One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.) Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2) Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person. But for the price, you can't beat it.</td><td>A memory card that surpasses the original...</td><td>1384560000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-16</td><td>353</td><td>2073</td><td>0.14034322820037107</td></tr><tr><td>284</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A8JNGNFJYGPXS</td><td>9629971372</td><td>Ann Baker</td><td>So far so good it saves the games that need to be saved.

It's exactly the same size, there is no size fitting issue, it looks and acts like a regular memory card, and has fifteen times more space for saved games then the regular 8 Meg cards! The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times. The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was \"Stuntman Ignition\" (possibly \"Stuntman\" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.  The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB.

If your games do not have difficulty with the size, then go for it. (End of edit 28 Jan 2012) If you think the price is good for an 8mb memory card, then by all means, go ahead. Although the card and the packaging are both labeled as 128mb, unless you are more fortunate than I, you will find yourself with no more than 8mb when you insert it into the PS2.

Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this.

The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game. Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked. Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games. It contains a hilarious singing intro, 4 new characters, and other enhancements.</td><td>So bad it's entertaining</td><td>1102118400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-12-04</td><td>220</td><td>1283</td><td>0.031172438672438678</td></tr><tr><td>405</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AWFDFLR1DA23A</td><td>B000003SQQ</td><td>stephen Garry</td><td>I have been a fan of the whole of the Clay Fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one.

Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. \"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it. It's definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the \"Myst\" era.</td><td>One of the best search and explore games</td><td>969148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-09-17</td><td>276</td><td>1457</td><td>0.13963675213675214</td></tr><tr><td>409</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1K0L2PKZLISWJ</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>P.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.</td><td>One of the best 2D fighters on the original Playstation</td><td>1080691200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-03-31</td><td>377</td><td>1956</td><td>0.05505952380952383</td></tr><tr><td>411</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>Zachary</td><td>Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom! Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version. Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade! Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS! Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\") 2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\") 3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.) 4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!) 5. Wolverine (The cheap one) 6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!) 7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\") 8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.) 9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.) 10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.) Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you.

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way. Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well. The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons. As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game</td><td>MegaMan: ocarina of final fantasy</td><td>1392854400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-20</td><td>486</td><td>2596</td><td>0.060585016835016825</td></tr><tr><td>423</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQ0IPFCF1UM92</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Kevin M.</td><td>Well as far as the person who sold this to me goes, the game came as described and in a well timed manner and I would shop here again.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.</td><td>My Favorite Game or All Time</td><td>1209859200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-05-04</td><td>664</td><td>3912</td><td>0.022993430987617042</td></tr><tr><td>432</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2GW1DBM406VU1</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Jarrett P.

Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert. I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist.

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.</td><td>Mega Man in 3D</td><td>1153094400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-17</td><td>1339</td><td>6859</td><td>0.06679526173060656</td></tr><tr><td>436</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>AMZCQIDUWDHLC</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>John. N</td><td>To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding. Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark. Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids. The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here. So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter). The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series. In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.</td><td>A good game with lots of heart...</td><td>1118275200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-06-09</td><td>523</td><td>2980</td><td>0.13132632293080052</td></tr><tr><td>437</td><td>4.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>A2329GPAT2XIIZ</td><td>B000006P0M</td><td>Ultimate Reviewer</td><td>For the \"Ace combat\" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original \"Ace Combat\" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed \"Ace Combat\" too, in the beginning.

The one quarrel I have, though it is a given for all pre 96ish (i think) PlayStation games is you can't use the analog sticks, which i always used in the third AC, and even though it's just a little stick, not having it really takes away from the flying feel.</td><td>Fun but No Sticks</td><td>1289001600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-11-06</td><td>115</td><td>570</td><td>0.13624999999999998</td></tr><tr><td>439</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1D2G65W3QHBIQ</td><td>B000006P0M</td><td>Oscar Galvez</td><td>This is an excellent game for spending some time on.

And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2... If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed. The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself. In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.</td><td>Take to the Skies</td><td>1205712000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-03-17</td><td>414</td><td>2333</td><td>0.1981759955444165</td></tr><tr><td>441</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JG09K1W72Q5</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Brandon</td><td>Most Teekns fans carer started with Tekken 3.  And if you were an aracde aholic, it started with 2.  Had this been the easrly 90's this gamewould have got 5 stars hands down.  But over the years, this game is aged.  Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.  Which, again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkens.</td><td>An overlooked classic</td><td>1009238400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-12-25</td><td>290</td><td>1547</td><td>0.03250694444444444</td></tr><tr><td>442</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AN44BACJ7QZ21</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Jonathan Pfeffer</td><td>works well for me, except i can't get my championships to show at the end.

Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.

Jongeling</td><td>While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started. On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.</td><td>The building block of the Tekken series</td><td>1339200000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-06-09</td><td>292</td><td>1583</td><td>0.03724419519874065</td></tr><tr><td>445</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3PVGP99ZTBGV2</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Matthew Rickard</td><td>Ever since I was young, I have been in love with the Tekken series.

The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance.

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play.

Now  I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of  Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed  the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other  members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful  music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of  all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.</td><td>Of dragons and boredom</td><td>965692800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-08</td><td>428</td><td>2282</td><td>-0.02076719576719576</td></tr><tr><td>454</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OVX97R347HXC</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.</td><td>Just didn't meet my expectations.</td><td>964742400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-28</td><td>521</td><td>2514</td><td>0.06674708624708622</td></tr><tr><td>455</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GM5B6DK9KP22</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Junkhog</td><td>Perfect</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1464307200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-05-27</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>456</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A119Q9NFGVOEJZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Ivan Orozco</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's the best of the best capcom rocks all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 rocks breath of fire 5 is the greatest video game company in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 5 rocks,breath of fire 6 is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 6 rocks</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's</td><td>1437609600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-07-23</td><td>109</td><td>553</td><td>0.5968253968253967</td></tr><tr><td>457</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A14IQPHOQ9LAYH</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Adam Hatton</td><td>haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright</td><td>awesome</td><td>1402704000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-06-14</td><td>20</td><td>99</td><td>0.12499999999999999</td></tr><tr><td>458</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1296CMAKC79FZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Andrea W</td><td>Item arrived on time and as described.

Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.</td><td>It keeps getting better</td><td>1065225600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-10-04</td><td>682</td><td>4153</td><td>0.06555177626606198</td></tr><tr><td>464</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AACIKO4GH062J</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Eric C.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.

The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners.

The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.</td><td>Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game</td><td>982886400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-02-23</td><td>201</td><td>1034</td><td>-0.1804673721340388</td></tr><tr><td>472</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A32GARQ84MVVYV</td><td>B000006P0K</td><td>Taylor Moore</td><td>Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about. Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games. For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes. The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling). Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME.

It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.</td><td>Butchered arcade to home conversion</td><td>1107129600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-01-31</td><td>160</td><td>856</td><td>0.0847953216374269</td></tr><tr><td>497</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2GAP7XWBZU8QI</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Eric</td><td>I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.  I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.</td><td>What was Capcom thinking?</td><td>1069286400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-11-20</td><td>144</td><td>723</td><td>-0.2076388888888889</td></tr><tr><td>498</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.</td><td>This game is bad</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td><td>487</td><td>2898</td><td>9.550712940543505E-4</td></tr><tr><td>499</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2CKNSDDC5XOFG</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX \"greatest hits\" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.</td><td>Concept is good, but tedious game play really spoils the fun</td><td>999043200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-08-29</td><td>265</td><td>1427</td><td>-0.06213804713804711</td></tr><tr><td>504</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AK00PWOR3BNAQ</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>MacArthur Davis</td><td>Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!!

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have. Highly recommend, 5 stars.</td><td>One of the greatest RPG's ever, maybe the greatest ever</td><td>1351555200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-10-30</td><td>540</td><td>2995</td><td>0.15720915032679736</td></tr><tr><td>526</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1XFHZKXQNS8ML</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Miamonkey89</td><td>I absolutely love Tomb Raider.

Prince: Sands of Time, Soul Reaver, God of War and many others are based on some things that Tomb Raider made popular. Game would be perfect if save points were better placed. It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times... What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level. Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart.

Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D?

Erickson</td><td>OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden \"secrets,\" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous \"medi-paks.\" Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.</td><td>The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff</td><td>1100563200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-11-16</td><td>438</td><td>2507</td><td>0.03362121212121214</td></tr><tr><td>531</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1FD8LITJZE48V</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Frank Ponce</td><td>Ok, sounds perveted. It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy, adventurous, and alluring Lara Croft, but many other people do too. Anyway, this is it. The first \"Tomb Raider\" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all. It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every \"Tomb Raider\" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!

Convery</td><td>If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.

In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...</td><td>Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!</td><td>1031011200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-03</td><td>752</td><td>4198</td><td>0.07733110119047616</td></tr><tr><td>534</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway.

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.</td><td>An Outstanding Game Certainly to Become a Classic</td><td>1023580800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-09</td><td>244</td><td>1332</td><td>0.2570068027210884</td></tr><tr><td>536</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A2JVBNO9A6JAVV</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>C-N-G</td><td>Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time.

Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?

Jongeling</td><td>Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game. There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile. The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face. You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it. All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time.

Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot. You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing \"Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo\" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world. Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz. Start on Track 2, sit back, and enjoy the only good thing about this game.</td><td>Pretty awful</td><td>1144886400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-04-13</td><td>276</td><td>1586</td><td>-0.12327551834130779</td></tr><tr><td>547</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ACMO0RPLWYRHV</td><td>B000006RGQ</td><td>Remy</td><td>Alrighty, let me just start off by saying don't let people who play \"Final Fantsay 7\" sway your judgement about this.  While \"Final Fantsay 7\" is an amazing game, it varies VERY HEAVILY from \"Fighting Force\", so what some people like (fun fighting games)and others love (RPG gamers) we are at war with the worlds.  It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really \"snazzy\" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a \"Streets of Rage\" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:   Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.   Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5   Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)   Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.  I feel this game is totally undercredited, and that we need to change that.  ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!</td><td>C'mon people, play nice.

I have only played a demo that my cousin has but I'm dying to pick up a copy. The demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like we're going to a party at the building at the end of the demo. This game is kind of funny. Some of the enemies are pure fools. I like to run around the van with them chasing. Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them. I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies. That's pretty funny too. The characters have awesome moves.

In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.</td><td>The Best Game in an Outstanding Series</td><td>1024444800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-19</td><td>200</td><td>1085</td><td>0.10452950558213715</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AX8NRG579WOCV</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>N.

When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed. I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically. The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game. So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.

It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best. The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end, and get every secret without any hints.  One of my top favorite five video games of all time.

But, even though there isn't as much actual \"Tomb Raiding\" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game.

You'll never feel such joy until you play this. It's definitely different than the first. In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them. Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs. The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see... You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles. there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did.

But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. \"The Wall\" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc \"old and scratched up\" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.</td><td>Still holds up</td><td>1045526400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-02-18</td><td>385</td><td>2076</td><td>0.12538961038961038</td></tr><tr><td>574</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>A3HTX1NOTTWERP</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Busy Body</td><td>Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got! After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian. OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).</td><td>I need this and the second one</td><td>1150502400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-06-17</td><td>338</td><td>1951</td><td>0.17961760461760468</td></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Zachary</td><td>The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos. Lets go over it: 1st - classic with no supers lots of characters 2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters 3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.</td><td>One thing people are missing to consider about this game!</td><td>1072569600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-12-28</td><td>227</td><td>1173</td><td>0.1735294117647059</td></tr><tr><td>581</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name \"Street Fighter II\" is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a \"collection\" that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley. But fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting.</td><td>Good but not great</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td><td>347</td><td>2058</td><td>0.13286019536019533</td></tr><tr><td>582</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>A1LEN6BO4XR1DI</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Sean Shannon</td><td>Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.</td><td>Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired</td><td>986947200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-04-11</td><td>306</td><td>1844</td><td>0.16902116402116402</td></tr><tr><td>583</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JHJ48J9EZNMH</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Robert evans</td><td>This wwf game sucks...

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead</td><td>Boring Game!</td><td>1400716800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-05-22</td><td>507</td><td>2651</td><td>-0.11963675213675214</td></tr><tr><td>586</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3TQTYD0D6AUO3</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Steve F</td><td>Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.</td><td>the absolute low point</td><td>1152748800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-13</td><td>907</td><td>4714</td><td>-0.03689865462406451</td></tr><tr><td>588</td><td>4.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>AAQ75C4BJUQLO</td><td>B000009QCX</td><td>Sixto Limiac</td><td>Kartia: \"The Word Of Fate\" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!</td><td>RPGs, you gotta love em'</td><td>968457600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-09-09</td><td>657</td><td>3572</td><td>0.11732580037664778</td></tr><tr><td>589</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>AQ7OZH6CSCTY6</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days, so it's nice when a good one comes along. Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off. Overall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.</td><td>Very Fun Game</td><td>1366675200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-04-23</td><td>279</td><td>1426</td><td>0.10229328165374679</td></tr><tr><td>593</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A305MT5Y9I4T69</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Charles B Valentino</td><td>This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone. Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to \"buy\" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides. If you are a fan of Mario Kart 64 style crossfires, I think you'll find this is a unique addition to your N64 collection.</td><td>Fun and relatively hard to find in used game stores</td><td>1140220800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-02-18</td><td>225</td><td>1202</td><td>0.17114624505928855</td></tr><tr><td>594</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>ADP72IJRH95ZG</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>Deborah B</td><td>This game is a lot of fun, with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully. I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more, but I think you  still see enough of them to keep most fans happy, plus I found the  character of Agent Willmore (whom you play) to be very likeable. The  storyline is very strong, the puzzles make sense, and the full motion video  (FMV) sequences are very good. There are not very many FMV games around  anymore, so if you like your adventure games with video sequences, this is  really a \"must have\".</td><td>A must for FMV adventure fans</td><td>943747200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>1999-11-28</td><td>115</td><td>603</td><td>0.2022161172161172</td></tr><tr><td>595</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A116ZSMZRT9RUN</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>David Noelle</td><td>This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile.  Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those \"other agents\" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.</td><td>A good mystery game for X-Philes</td><td>1046822400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-03-05</td><td>249</td><td>1319</td><td>0.03521505376344086</td></tr><tr><td>596</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A160AB64G2E949</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>B. GOODWIN</td><td>This was a pretty good game, but not a great game. I'd probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars. You are agent Craig Wilmore. Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the \"bad\" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer. Why was this so hard?). Overall, a good game, but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game.</td><td>Pretty good game.</td><td>982022400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-02-13</td><td>182</td><td>946</td><td>0.10632183908045978</td></tr><tr><td>597</td><td>4.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2L375A8IWXEGI</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>Herve Bronnimann</td><td>We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going. The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.</td><td>It's a good entertainment</td><td>966643200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-19</td><td>299</td><td>1530</td><td>-0.003249678249678262</td></tr><tr><td>598</td><td>5.0</td><td>20</td><td>false</td><td>A3S87ZOPB3UM9N</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>atmj</td><td>As a fan of Myst and Riven, I would not put this game in the same  category.  However, it does equally well for it's type.  Myst and Riven  don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you  have a name and a face. The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore.  He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully.  As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining. I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot. The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up. All in all a good buy.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1. Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series. Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.</td><td>Twisted Metal Series Review</td><td>1386115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-12-04</td><td>647</td><td>3419</td><td>0.026118626743626753</td></tr><tr><td>622</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A22QYM5WUYSKHK</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>Travis Foster</td><td>Although I should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition I was not satisfied.

Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that. The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore. In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.</td><td>good game</td><td>1062720000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-09-05</td><td>655</td><td>3830</td><td>0.024933213716108453</td></tr><tr><td>639</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OUKHGJ85XN4U</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Charles H.</td><td>I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played. Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire! Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions. Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots. Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect. Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is? It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.</td><td>The Force Is Strong In This Game</td><td>1344988800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-08-15</td><td>360</td><td>2006</td><td>0.06476584022038567</td></tr><tr><td>640</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JAICBAZ3YHF1</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>michael</td><td>star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you're not a star wars fan you won't regret it</td><td>star wars rogue squadron ROCKS</td><td>1301616000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-04-01</td><td>28</td><td>135</td><td>0.0111111111111111</td></tr><tr><td>641</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV56CQTOGFTCJ</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Jake</td><td>This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed. I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system. That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it. As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high. But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well.

The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways. Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying. New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done. The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter. (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating. Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor* The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited. All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability. If you can find this cheap, get it.

This game was the chief reason for my system  being upgraded!  Also, remember the sleek weapons I described?  Well,  they're sleek, but that's it.  For crying out loud, it takes THREE HITS  with a ROCKET LAUNCHER to kill one of the BASIC enemies (the Skaarj).  There's no bang to them at all!  Plus, another good thing about Unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computer-controlled  opponents (bots).  Sounds good, right?  Wrong.  Unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way, simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zig-zag in a way that is impossible to hit, all while shooting at you  with godlike aim!  Other than the steep system requirements, the  difficulty of the bots, and the bangless weapons, the game is very good and  highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.</td><td>Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64</td><td>1031788800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-12</td><td>587</td><td>3385</td><td>0.12218356270595074</td></tr><tr><td>660</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A3SF50Z5Q7PJA4</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Casey Aytes</td><td>Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.

As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \"Mission Complete\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up.

The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.

After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold. The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth. As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while. The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them. It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.</td><td>I just love blasting TIE'S....</td><td>1006128000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-11-19</td><td>648</td><td>3525</td><td>0.16896515165745934</td></tr><tr><td>663</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EAONPHFORLH</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Joshua Swanson</td><td>This game is great for Star Wars fans!

The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals.

In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.</td><td>Not quite what I remembered</td><td>1289433600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-11-11</td><td>103</td><td>518</td><td>0.07892156862745102</td></tr><tr><td>681</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>The Trophy</td><td>If you don't read anything else: If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like \"Big Mountain 2000,\" \"Twisted Edge,\" or even \"Snowboard Kids\" or \"Snowboard Kids 2.\" Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64. 9/10</td><td>Finally; a great snowboarding game.</td><td>1144540800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-04-09</td><td>235</td><td>1275</td><td>0.15113365800865797</td></tr><tr><td>684</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A37QIM8W556IMQ</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Teresa A.

The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.   It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.   This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player. If you have a will and a friend however, this game will surely be worth it.</td><td>An Adequate N64 snowboarding game.</td><td>994982400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-07-13</td><td>209</td><td>1045</td><td>-0.02545351473922903</td></tr><tr><td>686</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AODCE1AC7NOHW</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>In comparison to other N64 games, this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder, and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.

The sound track is pretty good, too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk, and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too. My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the \"Black Diamond\" level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe. I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.</td><td>A Must-Buy for everyone's N64 Collection...</td><td>977702400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-12-25</td><td>161</td><td>899</td><td>0.17348484848484846</td></tr><tr><td>688</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1J1B8IHW9W848</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Jon Mcfly</td><td>The game in many ways is like tony hawk.

The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal. The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game. Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.</td><td>The best snowboarding game, hands down.</td><td>975801600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-12-03</td><td>223</td><td>1285</td><td>0.1258075933075933</td></tr><tr><td>690</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GR16E8SMWUCF</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>R.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together. Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it. Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic. I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before. The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia. Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it. Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner. In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to \"Final Fantasy VII\", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: \"Final Fantasy VII\"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.

Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do. Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.) Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun) Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING) Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version) Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do) Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game) Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.  I would know, because I said the same thing.</td><td>Legendary</td><td>1161820800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-10-26</td><td>469</td><td>2550</td><td>0.10888047138047137</td></tr><tr><td>696</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A4CNLZGR3NM23</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>Samantha Rinne Hooker</td><td>An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment. The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development. FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle (Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on) FFII- wound-developable characters (Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.) FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills) FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin) FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it) FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills) FF7- basic weapon system FF8- GF system FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>1131148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-11-05</td><td>290</td><td>1709</td><td>0.013789682539682536</td></tr><tr><td>697</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24XAFHKD0NT28</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>cloud_mcaeris</td><td>FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world, in fact, it is my whole world.

Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret, a man who's arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery.  Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER, Shin-Ra's private army.  Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER, who has been lost for many years.  Now, Cloud is working with Avalanche, and Sephiroth has resurfaced, but he is now an insane, powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world.  Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user.  This game has a great story and a great battle engine, where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia.

One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time.

Realizing he is being duped, Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED.

Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it? Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have. Especially if you're already dead. That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?). Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years. Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client. And that's when he gets in over his head. The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake. Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.

All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked.

I originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world,  the characters, and the dozens of things to do. You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world. I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns. This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons? The story was amazingly detailed, the characters  were all unique, and the game pulled no punches.

Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing. You follow the character Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the dead, guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible. For some reason, Manny is denied any premium clients. Whos behind all this? Find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow, to the edge of the world and back again. Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir-ish music immerse you in the atmosphere. Clever interface and variable controls are great. A very involving game. Not too long not too short.

You will fall in love with the characters, you'll wish you could jump right into the world. The game's events are structured very well(except for the ever-present \"level up before the final boss\" stage of the game). The graphics are wonderful in their own right. It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be. But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller). And otherwise, this is a striaght port so you're not missing anything if you go for the PS version.

Blessen</td><td>Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter. Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies. The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating. The interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story. The  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.</td><td>Original and Literate</td><td>957571200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-06</td><td>456</td><td>2598</td><td>0.1102777777777778</td></tr><tr><td>742</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A233JF1T2IIBLT</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Genesis Whitmore</td><td>I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango.  An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did. Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday. Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango. The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another. The things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone, this would be it.</td><td>Probably the best adventure game ever made</td><td>957312000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-03</td><td>248</td><td>1239</td><td>-0.0979341736694678</td></tr><tr><td>743</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A243HY69GIAHFI</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>tropic_of_criticism</td><td>Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution.  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games. True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout. If I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized. Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available. Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.</td><td>LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future</td><td>956880000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-04-28</td><td>539</td><td>2863</td><td>0.07922867063492063</td></tr><tr><td>744</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3N1V8LIFT0RU6</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...

Also, the music in this game is PHENOMENAL. Did you know that there is a Zelda soundtrack you can purchase? There are also some guide books and online walk throughs if you find yourself a little stuck and are in need of some helpful hints.

It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really! Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game. The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer.

It looked to childish, to easy, and just basically stupid.  Comming from the  epic company Rareware, I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about.  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.  And even little guys called Jinjo's are here for you to collect,  so they can help you on your journey, through a forest, islands, deserts,  and many other worlds.  If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done.  The music is  also a plus feature on this game.  With so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes, you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this game.</td><td>So much fun, it's not even funny.</td><td>965260800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-03</td><td>338</td><td>1640</td><td>0.06243888888888889</td></tr><tr><td>811</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2D66KSHQQHOSD</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Green Level Clearance</td><td>Hands down the hardest game of the first three.  The graphics were better and Lara had new moves.  But the game took an almost insane turn for hardness.  Not the best pick for your first Tomb Raider experience. The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?

This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything. But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty. If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that. Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?) It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point. By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison. At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least. Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it. BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, \"Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery\" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.</td><td>Not difficult, impossible.

With its promotional montage, you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conker's game another cartoony adventure rather than the adult-oriented one they ended up making.  - Anyway the game is fantastic, a perfect supplement to Super Mario 64. In some ways it's actually better. When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats, to just have fun and explore. I played it enough times to 100% the game in two hours.

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me? The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at. Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels. Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!! Yippee. Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck! But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3. If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!</td><td>TOO HARD</td><td>1086998400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-06-12</td><td>457</td><td>2465</td><td>-0.06226068428853755</td></tr><tr><td>834</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.

The levels consist of timed events e.g. flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closes. The graphics are good as is the music. The story is non-existent though. Something about aliens, and it includes one of the worst and shortest endings in all of Video Game history. It's fun yet frustrating.

This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission. Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor. So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title. Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least.

Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it. Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either. You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money. Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term. It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme. But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games. If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely. Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times. But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.</td><td>Lara's the One (on the Playstation)</td><td>966297600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-15</td><td>342</td><td>1713</td><td>0.08612258953168045</td></tr><tr><td>847</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV8PFPPTB6I5V</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Jared Phillips</td><td>One of if not the best game on the n64.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1475452800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-10-03</td><td>10</td><td>39</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>848</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A198I1P469E3L8</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>leif hudson</td><td>It's okay, but I still don't see why everyone talks about this game.

It can get pretty intense on split screen, seriously. 5 stars for the split screen! 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit.

I enjoy everything about it (still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the 'invisible walls' and oddly prism shaped bottles etc). The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games, all of the items are used. There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub.

My cousin and I love to blow up the enemies and scientists.

I still have yet to beat the last level \"Cradle\" and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years, and yet I am addicted to trying over and over. I finished the Campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties. Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo. There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is. No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day. The remakes have been complete crap, despite the amazing COD engine.

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered. REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers. REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode. If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends.

It is the best of the best. The levels are action packed and extremely memorable. I can do the levels in my head I've played them so many times. The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best. Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5 Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5 Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/ Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5 Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5 Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers! A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play. Story: You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself. Gameplay: To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it. Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it. Controls: They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process. Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it. Music: *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part. Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P Oh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :( Replay Value: It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations. Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard). But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage. ______ If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Berk</td><td>GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release. This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer. The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience. (Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)</td><td>One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!</td><td>1238371200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2009-03-30</td><td>395</td><td>2123</td><td>0.11000778089013383</td></tr><tr><td>890</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series. One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too. The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust. While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game. Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness. The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there. The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration. The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time. Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies. The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot. If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence. Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting. Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die. Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be). Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!</td><td>a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star</td><td>1374796800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-07-26</td><td>3166</td><td>18299</td><td>0.01921526234026231</td></tr><tr><td>891</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A36QIF5IIJ5EJX</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>K_Renny</td><td>One of the best games of all time.

I didn't know much about Zelda, and had only played very few games before, but was mesmerized by this game. The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative; it really draws you in to the story. I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game. What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil. Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure.

Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with \"slappers only.\" In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill. The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different. The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives). Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it. This is Rare's N64 Masterwork ( Perfect Dark is pretty sweet, too).</td><td>Nobody Does It Better- The Defining Console Shooter</td><td>1204588800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-03-04</td><td>248</td><td>1481</td><td>0.1937003968253968</td></tr><tr><td>898</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1DH48UGGWMG5P</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>gmt_749</td><td>I am a major player of 007 games.

Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter. The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun. Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life, but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare's wonderful game.

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems. The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it. There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby. The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there. Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000. If you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.</td><td>Same as the original</td><td>1108512000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-02-16</td><td>414</td><td>2347</td><td>0.008249403657566916</td></tr><tr><td>918</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EICDA6FL5VK</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Johnny B.

It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent. There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die. Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill. Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening. The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away. This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.</td><td>Difficult</td><td>1120953600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-07-10</td><td>321</td><td>1604</td><td>-0.07963516746411482</td></tr><tr><td>922</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AD0J5KK4WQXNS</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>OverTheMoon</td><td>Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5. ...............socks</td><td>Still a fun game...TS v RA2?</td><td>1013558400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-02-13</td><td>640</td><td>3545</td><td>0.12712923306008414</td></tr><tr><td>927</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AG5RAVN4WSXXJ</td><td>B00000DMA8</td><td>Crash999 a PC and XBox gamer</td><td>Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money.

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome.

It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"</td><td>banjo kapooie</td><td>1376265600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-08-12</td><td>668</td><td>3827</td><td>0.05244962378890951</td></tr><tr><td>937</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AJPTIO3SH82S7</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>brutusmuktuk</td><td>Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth. The Good: + A fun story + An imaginative use of its characters + Creative worlds to explore The Bad: -- Too easy and short -- The few parts that are too hard The Ugly ? Why is Kazooie so insulting? Story--9/10 The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself? Gameplay--8/10 Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all? There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing). These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable. Longevity--5/10 A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.</td><td>A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush</td><td>1371600000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-06-19</td><td>745</td><td>4229</td><td>0.06853616522366522</td></tr><tr><td>938</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>ASFAJ90S77BZH</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Granny Samples</td><td>OMGosh !! . .

I wasn't to familiar with the C&C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series. If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way! The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at!

Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base! That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks...

If you want to have about a 65% chance of winning, stick with NOD. I wouldn't recommend the missions, because they are all too easy or all too hard.  I stick to skirmish and internet games myself. I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend. All-in-all, I would have to say that the graphics are superb, stories are bad,  sound is so-so, and gameplay is dependant on which side you choose(NOD being better).</td><td>It's alright, but not the best.</td><td>982454400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-02-18</td><td>169</td><td>884</td><td>0.2420138888888889</td></tr><tr><td>945</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A19646YDU8IH1I</td><td>B00000DMA8</td><td>Robert Ian Farquhar</td><td>Okay I admit it, the two main reasons I bought this game are James Earl  Jones and Michael Biehn, whom I believe are bloody great.

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee  aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i don't think so.  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is  about (no real actors - jus  bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games.  Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old C&C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they haven't been looking for, they disgrace the game.  We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if you're a  serious fan of C&C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have remembered.</td><td>Not a copycat of Red Alert; better than Starcraft</td><td>964224000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-22</td><td>414</td><td>2088</td><td>0.00853026058908412</td></tr><tr><td>948</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1E8F0AYFXPCRB</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Derrick</td><td>This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters.

Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap \"hover units\".   However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics,  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but  close enough).

It is spectacular in the graphics sense, but the story just left me out to dry.  The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better.

The game play units are completely  unbalanced!  On GDI side, all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank  Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is.  On the  NOD side, amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in  your way.

Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.

Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review. First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay. In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected. There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver. I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman. I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality. What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.</td><td>Banjo Kazooie</td><td>1283212800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-08-31</td><td>926</td><td>5143</td><td>0.121807417027417</td></tr><tr><td>965</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ANIOV3E6MR50R</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>jack harris</td><td>work as advertised.</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>1467936000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-08</td><td>3</td><td>19</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>966</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2TKKB683DPZXU</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Avidshopr83</td><td>Works but have to clean every time, love the game</td><td>love the</td><td>1467417600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-02</td><td>10</td><td>49</td><td>0.15555555555555556</td></tr><tr><td>967</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24JQTKGA5RAKX</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>JoeAZ92</td><td>Positive: + gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time + worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content + music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots + sharp controls that work well for the most part Negative: - you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world - camera doesn't always give you the best view you need Super Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie. Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth. The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too. Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area. But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds. Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times. One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool. Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.

Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back. The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage. This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid.

The Story: Banjo's sister, Tooty, was \"the most beautiful girl around\" and Grunty the witch wanted her beauty, so she pulled an Amber Alert and took her to her lair. Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back. Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good. Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways. Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much. Once more, I highly recommend this game.</td><td>The first half of Rare's crowning N64 achievement</td><td>1122768000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-07-31</td><td>263</td><td>1433</td><td>0.017387387387387383</td></tr><tr><td>977</td><td>3.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>A2TYI07XVELX2M</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>videogamefan</td><td>Many people believe that this is a copy of Super Mario 64.

If you are into strategy and action games the two games you should have in mind are Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie. But, suppose you could only take one. Which would you purchase? Both are almost the same. If you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious, both are for you. Overall, since Banjo-Kazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzle-finding feature to it, I would suggest you pick up Banjo-Kazooie first and then either get Banjo-Tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game, or get Super Mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game. Also, Banjo-Kazooie is A LOT easier than Super Mario 64.

You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time.

HOPEFULLY! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever. In fact it's one of the most amazing games in any genre period. It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.</td><td>Hit the power and prepare to be impressed.</td><td>1053388800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-05-20</td><td>246</td><td>1298</td><td>0.12662698412698414</td></tr><tr><td>984</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A1FT8KT8EW7ZS9</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>uh... tim</td><td>Rareware - words fail me. Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation. I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody. The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic. The story goes... The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game. Well, I hope you enjoy this game.

However, this game is far from deserving of the unreasonable prices and high praise it gets.</td><td>One of the most overrated games of all time.</td><td>1443916800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-10-04</td><td>90</td><td>487</td><td>0.028157894736842107</td></tr><tr><td>996</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A36FHU5F9PP8ML</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Skylar Etchieson</td><td>Runs perfectly, just as advertised.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1442966400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-09-23</td><td>5</td><td>35</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>997</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1H385GQQFLPAW</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Matthew</td><td>This game will teach you who your friends truly are as the blue shell destroys freindships and breaks bonds of companionship you never thought could be broken.</td><td>This game will teach you who your friends truly are ...</td><td>1441324800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-09-04</td><td>27</td><td>159</td><td>-0.26666666666666666</td></tr><tr><td>998</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3JNDV6D4911L0</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Shea Butta</td><td>Love this game, came on time , works perfectly on my n64..no glitches no freezes..just great play..i recommend</td><td>Love this game.</td><td>1438473600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-08-02</td><td>18</td><td>110</td><td>0.47500000000000003</td></tr><tr><td>999</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2F6MNRST15EF7</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>terence j mooney</td><td>great</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1436832000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-07-14</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>0.8</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000 rows.</div>"]}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#sorry for screaming this text out - here's a really well shaped potato: O; ok i'll be nice - 2 potatoes: OO"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#adding class weights to counter the imbalanced number of helpful, unhelpful reviews\n\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as f\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import FloatType\n\n# Re-balancing (weighting) of records to be used in the logistic loss objective function\nnumPositives = df.filter(df[\"label\"] == 1).count()\ndatasetSize = df.count()\nbalancingRatio = (datasetSize - numPositives) / datasetSize\nprint(\"numPositives   = {}\".format(numPositives))\nprint(\"datasetSize    = {}\".format(datasetSize))\nprint(\"balancingRatio = {}\".format(balancingRatio))\n\ndef calculateWeights(d, multiplier = 1):\n    if d == 1.0:\n      return multiplier * balancingRatio\n    else:\n      return (1.0 - balancingRatio)\n    \nudfcalculateWeights = f.udf(calculateWeights, FloatType())\n    \ndf = df.withColumn(\"classWeightCol\", udfcalculateWeights(df[\"label\"]))\n\ndisplay(df)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>reviewID</th><th>overall</th><th>vote</th><th>verified</th><th>reviewerID</th><th>asin</th><th>reviewerName</th><th>reviewText</th><th>summary</th><th>unixReviewTime</th><th>label</th><th>category</th><th>Review_Date</th><th>Review_Wordcount</th><th>Review_Length</th><th>Sentiment</th><th>classWeightCol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1HP7NVNPFMA4N</td><td>0700026657</td><td>Ambrosia075</td><td>This game is a bit hard to get the hang of, but when you do it's great.</td><td>but when you do it's great.</td><td>1445040000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-10-17</td><td>17</td><td>71</td><td>0.03611111111111113</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JGAP0185YJI6</td><td>0700026657</td><td>travis</td><td>I played it a while but it was alright.

And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.

First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie. As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations. I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game. ================================================================== Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!! I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?! Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense! You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory! The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO. Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design.

What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment). PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced. I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.</td><td>Dirt, Dirt 2, and Dirt 3</td><td>1354752000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-12-06</td><td>491</td><td>2507</td><td>0.13902107812822098</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AQTC623NCESZW</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Chesty Puller</td><td>I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS.

I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with. I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D.

Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.</td><td>awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-09-14</td><td>649</td><td>3492</td><td>0.007527056277056293</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQQQ3IA92VBGR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Steven Rea</td><td>The metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it.

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.

The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.</td><td>So awesome, but why no guide for A Link Between Worlds?</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td><td>245</td><td>1334</td><td>0.1710335497835498</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2AL1GN0TMTUXR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>ROB F.</td><td>this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!</td><td>LOZ is the best!</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-29</td><td>24</td><td>112</td><td>0.5035714285714287</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>true</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.</td><td>A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans</td><td>1385510400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-27</td><td>1082</td><td>5780</td><td>0.15944932648472473</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>4.0</td><td>55</td><td>true</td><td>A10PPCIFVK9ZT5</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Gary Coffman</td><td>I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already.

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have \"harmony\" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.  For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in.

The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protector(not a good day for anyone). The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged. Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the \"bottom\" of the device. The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing. In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad.

This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game). If you want a real flight sim this is not it.

The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time. You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game. It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then. I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all. If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2.

In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble. The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own. Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.</td><td>OK for PS/PS2, useless for N64</td><td>1313107200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-08-12</td><td>199</td><td>1133</td><td>0.12078664799253035</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>AHO7BK8TE581B</td><td>8565000168</td><td>pzkfw</td><td>I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64. Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB. I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results. PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers) Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly. Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work. PS2 MadCatz Controller: Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller. Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test. N64: I had two controllers to test with it. Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly. Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly. Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats. Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.</td><td>Great concept but equally flawed game....</td><td>1218585600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-08-13</td><td>544</td><td>2969</td><td>1.1630160883892396E-4</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3NIF89RBTYXZP</td><td>907843905X</td><td>The Plague Doctor</td><td>This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it.

I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller. I will definitly be ordering a few more later, a friend has a birthday coming up.</td><td>Xbox 360 Controller Skin, Black Silicone</td><td>1326931200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-01-19</td><td>192</td><td>1056</td><td>0.2553787878787879</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>195</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A17ND914NOQ1F2</td><td>9625990674</td><td>KUSOsan</td><td>Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller. Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long.</td><td>Great add on for your controller!</td><td>1326153600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-01-10</td><td>160</td><td>826</td><td>0.03628246753246755</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>196</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2OOR605L7T9EB</td><td>9625990674</td><td>Bruce M.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing. This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance. (One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.) Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2) Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person. But for the price, you can't beat it.</td><td>A memory card that surpasses the original...</td><td>1384560000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-11-16</td><td>353</td><td>2073</td><td>0.14034322820037107</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>284</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A8JNGNFJYGPXS</td><td>9629971372</td><td>Ann Baker</td><td>So far so good it saves the games that need to be saved.

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times. The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was \"Stuntman Ignition\" (possibly \"Stuntman\" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB.

If your games do not have difficulty with the size, then go for it. (End of edit 28 Jan 2012) If you think the price is good for an 8mb memory card, then by all means, go ahead.

The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear.

The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game. Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked. Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. \"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.</td><td>One of the best 2D fighters on the original Playstation</td><td>1080691200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-03-31</td><td>377</td><td>1956</td><td>0.05505952380952383</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>411</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>Zachary</td><td>Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom! Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version. Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade! Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS! Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\") 2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\") 3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.) 4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!) 5. Wolverine (The cheap one) 6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!) 7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\") 8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.) 9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.) 10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.) Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

The single-player is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that. The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you.

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way. Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well. The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons. As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game</td><td>MegaMan: ocarina of final fantasy</td><td>1392854400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-20</td><td>486</td><td>2596</td><td>0.060585016835016825</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>423</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AQ0IPFCF1UM92</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Kevin M.</td><td>Well as far as the person who sold this to me goes, the game came as described and in a well timed manner and I would shop here again.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.</td><td>My Favorite Game or All Time</td><td>1209859200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-05-04</td><td>664</td><td>3912</td><td>0.022993430987617042</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>432</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2GW1DBM406VU1</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Jarrett P.

I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist.

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.</td><td>Mega Man in 3D</td><td>1153094400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-17</td><td>1339</td><td>6859</td><td>0.06679526173060656</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>436</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>AMZCQIDUWDHLC</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>John. N</td><td>To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding. Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark. Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids. The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here. So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter). The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series. In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.</td><td>A good game with lots of heart...</td><td>1118275200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-06-09</td><td>523</td><td>2980</td><td>0.13132632293080052</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>437</td><td>4.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>A2329GPAT2XIIZ</td><td>B000006P0M</td><td>Ultimate Reviewer</td><td>For the \"Ace combat\" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original \"Ace Combat\" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed \"Ace Combat\" too, in the beginning.

And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2... If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed. The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself. In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.</td><td>Take to the Skies</td><td>1205712000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-03-17</td><td>414</td><td>2333</td><td>0.1981759955444165</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>441</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JG09K1W72Q5</td><td>B000006P0J</td><td>Brandon</td><td>Most Teekns fans carer started with Tekken 3.

Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.

On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more.

Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.</td><td>Breath of Fun, and Unoriginality</td><td>973296000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-11-04</td><td>334</td><td>1849</td><td>0.0030851063829787236</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>452</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>A3OXJB66H8LU8C</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Alex Valderana</td><td>Breath of Fire III's old-school graphics capture the feel of old RPGs, and how good they were, playing on NES and Super NES, back in the old days. Now  I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of  Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed  the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia,  Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game,  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other  members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful  music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of  all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system. Definitely  get this if you're a fan of Capcom RPGs.</td><td>By far one of the best RPGs in the world</td><td>967334400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-27</td><td>223</td><td>1157</td><td>0.24572510822510826</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>453</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A9998RE3AEA95</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Alex</td><td>To put it bluntly, Breath of Fire III is intolerably dull. The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.</td><td>Of dragons and boredom</td><td>965692800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-08</td><td>428</td><td>2282</td><td>-0.02076719576719576</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>454</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OVX97R347HXC</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.</td><td>Just didn't meet my expectations.</td><td>964742400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-28</td><td>521</td><td>2514</td><td>0.06674708624708622</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>455</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GM5B6DK9KP22</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Junkhog</td><td>Perfect</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1464307200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-05-27</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>456</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A119Q9NFGVOEJZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Ivan Orozco</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's the best of the best capcom rocks all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 rocks breath of fire 5 is the greatest video game company in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 5 rocks,breath of fire 6 is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 6 rocks</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's</td><td>1437609600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2015-07-23</td><td>109</td><td>553</td><td>0.5968253968253967</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>457</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A14IQPHOQ9LAYH</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Adam Hatton</td><td>haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright</td><td>awesome</td><td>1402704000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-06-14</td><td>20</td><td>99</td><td>0.12499999999999999</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>458</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1296CMAKC79FZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Andrea W</td><td>Item arrived on time and as described.

Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.</td><td>It keeps getting better</td><td>1065225600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-10-04</td><td>682</td><td>4153</td><td>0.06555177626606198</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>464</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AACIKO4GH062J</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Eric C.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.

The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.</td><td>Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game</td><td>982886400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-02-23</td><td>201</td><td>1034</td><td>-0.1804673721340388</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>472</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A32GARQ84MVVYV</td><td>B000006P0K</td><td>Taylor Moore</td><td>Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about. Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games. For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes. The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling). Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.</td><td>One of the best fighting games of all time</td><td>1390089600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-01-19</td><td>343</td><td>1920</td><td>0.16729586902459245</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>483</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3FB9N48TFRODM</td><td>B000006P0K</td><td>Chris</td><td>Thank you.........Wonderful....and Trusting product and seller.

Durham</td><td>To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.</td><td>Butchered arcade to home conversion</td><td>1107129600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-01-31</td><td>160</td><td>856</td><td>0.0847953216374269</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>497</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2GAP7XWBZU8QI</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Eric</td><td>I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.  I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.</td><td>What was Capcom thinking?</td><td>1069286400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-11-20</td><td>144</td><td>723</td><td>-0.2076388888888889</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>498</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.</td><td>This game is bad</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td><td>487</td><td>2898</td><td>9.550712940543505E-4</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>499</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2CKNSDDC5XOFG</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX \"greatest hits\" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.</td><td>Concept is good, but tedious game play really spoils the fun</td><td>999043200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-08-29</td><td>265</td><td>1427</td><td>-0.06213804713804711</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>504</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AK00PWOR3BNAQ</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>MacArthur Davis</td><td>Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!!

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game. However, I love this game, and recommend it to all who own a Playstation!</td><td>The first Klonoa game, an enchanting platform experiance!</td><td>1115683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-05-10</td><td>535</td><td>3007</td><td>0.05921907040328095</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>507</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3HINUXNB2R0SN</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>John Phelps</td><td>Went back and played this again.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.</td><td>Begin The Treasure Hunt!</td><td>1391558400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-05</td><td>507</td><td>2884</td><td>-0.005113422359185082</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>522</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A4Z9NHOW5LT0M</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>JoB</td><td>Tomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times... What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level. Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart.

The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls.

Erickson</td><td>OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden \"secrets,\" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous \"medi-paks.\" Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.</td><td>The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff</td><td>1100563200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-11-16</td><td>438</td><td>2507</td><td>0.03362121212121214</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>531</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1FD8LITJZE48V</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Frank Ponce</td><td>Ok, sounds perveted.

It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every \"Tomb Raider\" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did!

Convery</td><td>If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.

In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...</td><td>Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!</td><td>1031011200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-03</td><td>752</td><td>4198</td><td>0.07733110119047616</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>534</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway.

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.</td><td>An Outstanding Game Certainly to Become a Classic</td><td>1023580800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-09</td><td>244</td><td>1332</td><td>0.2570068027210884</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>536</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A2JVBNO9A6JAVV</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>C-N-G</td><td>Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time.

Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?

Jongeling</td><td>Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game. There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile. The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face. You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it. All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time.

Though only a little worse than Charlie's Angels (GameCube) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion (PlayStation2), Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight. Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot. You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing \"Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo\" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world. Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz.

While \"Final Fantsay 7\" is an amazing game, it varies VERY HEAVILY from \"Fighting Force\", so what some people like (fun fighting games)and others love (RPG gamers) we are at war with the worlds.  It's better to agree to disagree here.  Okay, let us begin with the review.  I love this game.  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really \"snazzy\" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a \"Streets of Rage\" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:   Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.   Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5   Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)   Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.

Some of the enemies are pure fools. I like to run around the van with them chasing. Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them. I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies. That's pretty funny too. The characters have awesome moves.

In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.</td><td>The Best Game in an Outstanding Series</td><td>1024444800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-06-19</td><td>200</td><td>1085</td><td>0.10452950558213715</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AX8NRG579WOCV</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>N.

When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed. I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically. The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game. So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.

It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best. The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.

But, even though there isn't as much actual \"Tomb Raiding\" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version.

Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs. The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see... You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles. there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did.

But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. \"The Wall\" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc \"old and scratched up\" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.</td><td>Still holds up</td><td>1045526400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-02-18</td><td>385</td><td>2076</td><td>0.12538961038961038</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>574</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>A3HTX1NOTTWERP</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Busy Body</td><td>Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got! After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian. OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).</td><td>I need this and the second one</td><td>1150502400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-06-17</td><td>338</td><td>1951</td><td>0.17961760461760468</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Zachary</td><td>The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos. Lets go over it: 1st - classic with no supers lots of characters 2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters 3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.</td><td>One thing people are missing to consider about this game!</td><td>1072569600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-12-28</td><td>227</td><td>1173</td><td>0.1735294117647059</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>581</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name \"Street Fighter II\" is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a \"collection\" that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley. But fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting.</td><td>Good but not great</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-08-13</td><td>347</td><td>2058</td><td>0.13286019536019533</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>582</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>A1LEN6BO4XR1DI</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Sean Shannon</td><td>Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.</td><td>Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired</td><td>986947200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-04-11</td><td>306</td><td>1844</td><td>0.16902116402116402</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>583</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JHJ48J9EZNMH</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Robert evans</td><td>This wwf game sucks...

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead</td><td>Boring Game!</td><td>1400716800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-05-22</td><td>507</td><td>2651</td><td>-0.11963675213675214</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>586</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3TQTYD0D6AUO3</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Steve F</td><td>Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.</td><td>the absolute low point</td><td>1152748800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-07-13</td><td>907</td><td>4714</td><td>-0.03689865462406451</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>588</td><td>4.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>AAQ75C4BJUQLO</td><td>B000009QCX</td><td>Sixto Limiac</td><td>Kartia: \"The Word Of Fate\" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!</td><td>RPGs, you gotta love em'</td><td>968457600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-09-09</td><td>657</td><td>3572</td><td>0.11732580037664778</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>589</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>AQ7OZH6CSCTY6</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days, so it's nice when a good one comes along. Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me. I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.

I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone. Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to \"buy\" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.

Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those \"other agents\" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.

Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the \"bad\" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer.

The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed).

As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining. I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot. The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up. All in all a good buy.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

Summary:(Read Below if you wanted More Info) 1= Very good 2=Great! 3= HIt or Miss with the more realistic physics 4= HIt or Miss Imo due to the character design styled more like 1 & 2 than 3 Black=First and Best PS2 Twisted Metal Arguably the best Twisted Metal of All Head On=Good Gameplay Online Mode included (psp and ps2) Spiritual Sequel to Twisted Metal 2 Twisted Metal (2012 for PS3)=Didnt play this one but heard it was good Twisted Metal: A great game, revolutionary for video games of the first 3d era. Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1. Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series. Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.</td><td>Twisted Metal Series Review</td><td>1386115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-12-04</td><td>647</td><td>3419</td><td>0.026118626743626753</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>622</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A22QYM5WUYSKHK</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>Travis Foster</td><td>Although I should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition I was not satisfied.

Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all.

The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.

A new developer 989 Studios took over for SingleTrac who developed the first games in the series. This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark. The game also allows you to hook up a multi-tap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourself.</td><td>New developer takes over the series</td><td>1229385600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-12-16</td><td>199</td><td>1119</td><td>-0.13607954545454545</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>634</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AP0OU57QNYSOS</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>Jake</td><td>How can anyone not like this game?

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that. The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore. In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.</td><td>good game</td><td>1062720000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-09-05</td><td>655</td><td>3830</td><td>0.024933213716108453</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>639</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2OUKHGJ85XN4U</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Charles H.</td><td>I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played. Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire! Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions. Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots. Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect. Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is? It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.</td><td>The Force Is Strong In This Game</td><td>1344988800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2012-08-15</td><td>360</td><td>2006</td><td>0.06476584022038567</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>640</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1JAICBAZ3YHF1</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>michael</td><td>star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you're not a star wars fan you won't regret it</td><td>star wars rogue squadron ROCKS</td><td>1301616000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-04-01</td><td>28</td><td>135</td><td>0.0111111111111111</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>641</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV56CQTOGFTCJ</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Jake</td><td>This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed. I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system. That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it. As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well. Overall, I actually kind of enjoyed this game.</td><td>Surprisingly fun</td><td>1103241600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-12-17</td><td>322</td><td>1744</td><td>0.035841473341473334</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>655</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AFNCXMCX7VZWH</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>J. Jongeling</td><td>Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways. Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying. New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done. The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter. (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating. Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor* The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited. All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability. If you can find this cheap, get it. Otherwise pass it up.</td><td>Lacks sorely when compared to previous installments</td><td>1052524800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-05-10</td><td>467</td><td>2605</td><td>-5.264752883800586E-4</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>656</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A2MMO0QPJS6SRD</td><td>B00000DMAM</td><td>Matt Curtis</td><td>Well, going into it, I heard that this was SO much better than Quake III arena.

Anything less than a PentiumII/300MHz  processor runs like garbage unless everything is turned down, and, well,  there goes the graphics!  This game was the chief reason for my system  being upgraded!  Also, remember the sleek weapons I described?  Well,  they're sleek, but that's it.  For crying out loud, it takes THREE HITS  with a ROCKET LAUNCHER to kill one of the BASIC enemies (the Skaarj).  There's no bang to them at all!  Plus, another good thing about Unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computer-controlled  opponents (bots).  Sounds good, right?  Wrong.  Unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way, simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zig-zag in a way that is impossible to hit, all while shooting at you  with godlike aim!  Other than the steep system requirements, the  difficulty of the bots, and the bangless weapons, the game is very good and  highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.</td><td>Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64</td><td>1031788800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-09-12</td><td>587</td><td>3385</td><td>0.12218356270595074</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>660</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A3SF50Z5Q7PJA4</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Casey Aytes</td><td>Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine. The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \"Mission Complete\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up.

The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.

After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold. The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth. As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while. The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them. It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.</td><td>I just love blasting TIE'S....</td><td>1006128000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-11-19</td><td>648</td><td>3525</td><td>0.16896515165745934</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>663</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EAONPHFORLH</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Joshua Swanson</td><td>This game is great for Star Wars fans!

The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals.

I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.</td><td>Not quite what I remembered</td><td>1289433600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-11-11</td><td>103</td><td>518</td><td>0.07892156862745102</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>681</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>The Trophy</td><td>If you don't read anything else: If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like \"Big Mountain 2000,\" \"Twisted Edge,\" or even \"Snowboard Kids\" or \"Snowboard Kids 2.\" Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64. 9/10</td><td>Finally; a great snowboarding game.</td><td>1144540800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2006-04-09</td><td>235</td><td>1275</td><td>0.15113365800865797</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>684</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A37QIM8W556IMQ</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Teresa A.

The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.   It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.   This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player. If you have a will and a friend however, this game will surely be worth it.</td><td>An Adequate N64 snowboarding game.</td><td>994982400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2001-07-13</td><td>209</td><td>1045</td><td>-0.02545351473922903</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>686</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AODCE1AC7NOHW</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>In comparison to other N64 games, this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder, and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.

The sound track is pretty good, too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk, and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too. My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the \"Black Diamond\" level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe. I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.</td><td>A Must-Buy for everyone's N64 Collection...</td><td>977702400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-12-25</td><td>161</td><td>899</td><td>0.17348484848484846</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>688</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1J1B8IHW9W848</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Jon Mcfly</td><td>The game in many ways is like tony hawk.

The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal. The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game. Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.</td><td>The best snowboarding game, hands down.</td><td>975801600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-12-03</td><td>223</td><td>1285</td><td>0.1258075933075933</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>690</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GR16E8SMWUCF</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>R.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together. Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it. Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic. I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before. The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia. Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it. Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner. In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to \"Final Fantasy VII\", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: \"Final Fantasy VII\"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.

I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do. Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.) Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun) Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING) Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version) Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do) Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game) Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.

They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>1131148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-11-05</td><td>290</td><td>1709</td><td>0.013789682539682536</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>697</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24XAFHKD0NT28</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>cloud_mcaeris</td><td>FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world, in fact, it is my whole world.

Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little.  I promise, you will not be disappointed.

Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret, a man who's arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery.  Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER, Shin-Ra's private army.  Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER, who has been lost for many years.  Now, Cloud is working with Avalanche, and Sephiroth has resurfaced, but he is now an insane, powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world.  Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user.  This game has a great story and a great battle engine, where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia.

One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time.

THIS IS HOW COMPUTER GAMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN - and not the pathetic cookie-cutter products of mega-corporations working in-tandem with GX-card companies...

Guess what: corruption is not limited just to this world. And where there is corruption, there is oppression; and where there is oppression, there is always a revolution brewing... Realizing he is being duped, Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED. Immersing noirish atmosphere, detailed art-deco settings, fast Bogartian dialogs - with a subtle ironic frosting. WARNING: There are known problems with today's faster processors.

From the moment i entered the tree, my deepest childish heart was immersed by The spooky chilling song of wonderus oblivion,  played with a dida jiu, envoks the dark gothical environment of smokey earth, a hidden sign of our own earthly desires and self destruction. the rest of the music is amazing and fits each place perfectly. I really like the hyrule field song of mystery and adventure. You gather items such as slingshots, bombs, magic spells, and the sword of time. This allows you to go to times and alter the other time to your advantage. The sun and moon take turns with night and day as you run through a beautiful hyrule field, a fire mountain and other magical places.  A legend of revolutionary gaming experience, exploration, story telling, magical youthfulness, a pioneer of open world environments with realistic time cycles.

Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it? Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have. Especially if you're already dead. That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?). Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years. Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client. And that's when he gets in over his head. The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake. Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.

All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked.

I originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world,  the characters, and the dozens of things to do. You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world. I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns. This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons? The story was amazingly detailed, the characters  were all unique, and the game pulled no punches.

It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be. But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer.

Blessen</td><td>Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter. Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies. The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating. The interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story. The  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.</td><td>Original and Literate</td><td>957571200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-06</td><td>456</td><td>2598</td><td>0.1102777777777778</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>742</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A233JF1T2IIBLT</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Genesis Whitmore</td><td>I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango.  An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did. Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday. Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango. The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another. The things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone, this would be it.</td><td>Probably the best adventure game ever made</td><td>957312000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-05-03</td><td>248</td><td>1239</td><td>-0.0979341736694678</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>743</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A243HY69GIAHFI</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>tropic_of_criticism</td><td>Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution.  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games. True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout. If I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized. Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available. Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.</td><td>LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future</td><td>956880000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-04-28</td><td>539</td><td>2863</td><td>0.07922867063492063</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>744</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3N1V8LIFT0RU6</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...

Also, the music in this game is PHENOMENAL. Did you know that there is a Zelda soundtrack you can purchase? There are also some guide books and online walk throughs if you find yourself a little stuck and are in need of some helpful hints.

Today this game remains a favorite among gamers. If you have kids & a N64 id take the xbox away for a day an have them play N64 so they can see where & how technology has taken Gaming.

It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really! Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game. The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives. Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters. A definite must have for all retro gamers and Bond fanatics alike.</td><td>A momentous release</td><td>1392076800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2014-02-11</td><td>328</td><td>1861</td><td>0.048125815982958835</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>808</td><td>5.0</td><td>13</td><td>true</td><td>A3NT5JXI3WUHA8</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>Tristan</td><td>Brings back memories of days long gone by.

It looked to childish, to easy, and just basically stupid.  Comming from the  epic company Rareware, I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about.  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.  And even little guys called Jinjo's are here for you to collect,  so they can help you on your journey, through a forest, islands, deserts,  and many other worlds.  If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done.  The music is  also a plus feature on this game.

The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?

I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything. But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty. If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that. Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?) It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point. By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison. At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least. Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it. BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, \"Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery\" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.</td><td>Not difficult, impossible.

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me? The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at. Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels. Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!! Yippee. Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck! But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3. If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!</td><td>TOO HARD</td><td>1086998400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-06-12</td><td>457</td><td>2465</td><td>-0.06226068428853755</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>834</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.

The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage.  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission. Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance.  Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor. So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title.

Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it. Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either. You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money. Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term. It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme. But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games. If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely. Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times. But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.</td><td>Lara's the One (on the Playstation)</td><td>966297600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-08-15</td><td>342</td><td>1713</td><td>0.08612258953168045</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>847</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AV8PFPPTB6I5V</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Jared Phillips</td><td>One of if not the best game on the n64.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1475452800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-10-03</td><td>10</td><td>39</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>848</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A198I1P469E3L8</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>leif hudson</td><td>It's okay, but I still don't see why everyone talks about this game.

There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub.

I still have yet to beat the last level \"Cradle\" and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years, and yet I am addicted to trying over and over. I finished the Campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties. Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo. There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is. No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day.

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered. REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers. REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode. If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends.

The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best. Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5 Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5 Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/ Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5 Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5 Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers! A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play. Story: You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself. Gameplay: To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it. Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it. Controls: They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process. Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it. Music: *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part. Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P Oh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :( Replay Value: It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations. Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard). But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage. ______ If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Berk</td><td>GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release. This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer. The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience. (Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)</td><td>One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!</td><td>1238371200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2009-03-30</td><td>395</td><td>2123</td><td>0.11000778089013383</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>890</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series. One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too. The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust. While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game. Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness. The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there. The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration. The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time. Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies. The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot. If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence. Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting. Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die. Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be). Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!</td><td>a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star</td><td>1374796800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-07-26</td><td>3166</td><td>18299</td><td>0.01921526234026231</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>891</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A36QIF5IIJ5EJX</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>K_Renny</td><td>One of the best games of all time.

I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game. What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil. Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure.

Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with \"slappers only.\" In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill. The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different. The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives). Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it. This is Rare's N64 Masterwork ( Perfect Dark is pretty sweet, too).</td><td>Nobody Does It Better- The Defining Console Shooter</td><td>1204588800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2008-03-04</td><td>248</td><td>1481</td><td>0.1937003968253968</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>898</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1DH48UGGWMG5P</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>gmt_749</td><td>I am a major player of 007 games.

O&#039;rourke</td><td>Goldeneye 007 on the now obsolete Ninetndo 64 is still to this day my favourite game of all time. Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter.

I love the variation in the worlds, from wandering the beaches of Treasure Trove Cove to the snowy winter wonderland of Freezeezy Peak.  The characters are fun, and the \"violence\" is very child-friendly.  My mom enjoyed listening to us play it enough she went out and bought the soundtrack so she could listen on her own!

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems. The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it. There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby. The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there. Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000. If you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.</td><td>Same as the original</td><td>1108512000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-02-16</td><td>414</td><td>2347</td><td>0.008249403657566916</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>918</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A10EICDA6FL5VK</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Johnny B.

There's two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie: hunting and gathering. You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds. You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole.

It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent. There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die. Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill. Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening. The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away. This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.</td><td>Difficult</td><td>1120953600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2005-07-10</td><td>321</td><td>1604</td><td>-0.07963516746411482</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>922</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>AD0J5KK4WQXNS</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>OverTheMoon</td><td>Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5. ...............socks</td><td>Still a fun game...TS v RA2?</td><td>1013558400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2002-02-13</td><td>640</td><td>3545</td><td>0.12712923306008414</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>927</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AG5RAVN4WSXXJ</td><td>B00000DMA8</td><td>Crash999 a PC and XBox gamer</td><td>Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money.

Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game.

It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"</td><td>banjo kapooie</td><td>1376265600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-08-12</td><td>668</td><td>3827</td><td>0.05244962378890951</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>937</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AJPTIO3SH82S7</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>brutusmuktuk</td><td>Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth. The Good: + A fun story + An imaginative use of its characters + Creative worlds to explore The Bad: -- Too easy and short -- The few parts that are too hard The Ugly ? Why is Kazooie so insulting? Story--9/10 The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself? Gameplay--8/10 Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all? There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing). These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable. Longevity--5/10 A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.</td><td>A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush</td><td>1371600000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2013-06-19</td><td>745</td><td>4229</td><td>0.06853616522366522</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>938</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>ASFAJ90S77BZH</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Granny Samples</td><td>OMGosh !! . .

I wasn't to familiar with the C&C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series. If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way! The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at! There just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off! This is a good value for the money. It may not be as great as AGE OF EMPIRES or STARCRAFT, but TIBERIAN SUN is fun nonetheless. Enjoy!</td><td>Great fun!

Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base! That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks... THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were). ....

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee  aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i don't think so.  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is  about (no real actors - jus  bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games.  Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old C&C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they haven't been looking for, they disgrace the game.  We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if you're a  serious fan of C&C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have remembered.</td><td>Not a copycat of Red Alert; better than Starcraft</td><td>964224000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2000-07-22</td><td>414</td><td>2088</td><td>0.00853026058908412</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>948</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1E8F0AYFXPCRB</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Derrick</td><td>This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters.

Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility.  And in my opinion, the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games (kazooie & tooie) on Nintendo 64.  Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous \"Banjo Threeie\" to life on any console!!</td><td>The Golden Age of Rareware</td><td>1320883200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2011-11-10</td><td>256</td><td>1327</td><td>0.2268450635386119</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>960</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A48BR00P5WEQZ</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Swagbot</td><td>This game is fantastic.

Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review. First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay. In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected. There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver. I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman. I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality. What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.</td><td>Banjo Kazooie</td><td>1283212800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2010-08-31</td><td>926</td><td>5143</td><td>0.121807417027417</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>965</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ANIOV3E6MR50R</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>jack harris</td><td>work as advertised.</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>1467936000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-08</td><td>3</td><td>19</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>966</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2TKKB683DPZXU</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Avidshopr83</td><td>Works but have to clean every time, love the game</td><td>love the</td><td>1467417600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td><td>2016-07-02</td><td>10</td><td>49</td><td>0.15555555555555556</td><td>0.1795545</td></tr><tr><td>967</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24JQTKGA5RAKX</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>JoeAZ92</td><td>Positive: + gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time + worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content + music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots + sharp controls that work well for the most part Negative: - you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world - camera doesn't always give you the best view you need Super Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie. Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth. The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too. Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area. But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds. Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times. One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool. Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.

Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back. The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage. This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid.

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back. Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good. Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways. Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much.

Of course, it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female, evil castle, jump on enemies, etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that, occasionally, it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president, they did so for a good cause, and a damn good game.</td><td>And their brother, Ukulele-Ocarina!</td><td>1078185600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2004-03-02</td><td>93</td><td>511</td><td>0.009615384615384607</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>980</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A1XG2DJ30UPU11</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>There is not much I can say except this is THE BEST GAME FOR N64.

HOPEFULLY! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever. In fact it's one of the most amazing games in any genre period. It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.</td><td>Hit the power and prepare to be impressed.</td><td>1053388800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td><td>2003-05-20</td><td>246</td><td>1298</td><td>0.12662698412698414</td><td>0.8204455</td></tr><tr><td>984</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A1FT8KT8EW7ZS9</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>uh... tim</td><td>Rareware - words fail me. Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation. I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody. The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic. The story goes... The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game. Well, I hope you enjoy this game.

If you have  been through a horrific situation as written in NOT YOUR LEGACY, please read this book. It'll show you how religious beliefs can interfere with human relationships, how one can cope and try and understand why people do the things they do, but most of all, you'll discover the strength of a woman far beyond her years and know you will have the strength you need during difficult times.

Then a mysterious girl appears in the attic of the house next door, and that's when the real troubles begin, for Susan might lose her daughter once again. I think this is more than just a paranormal story; it was about healing after a loss, staying strong, going on, and sharing love. Love is truly omnipotent. And love had a main role in the book. Whatever Susan, Alice, and even Caroline did, were mostly led by love, and love gave these women strength to fight back the evil entity from another dimension. A rather creepy entity.

From Stagger Lee and Frankie and Johnny to The Long Black Veil (more on that in a bit), Millers Cave, Timothy and a dozen other titles you or I could name, murder, theft and death are common topics of each medium. CRIME PLUS MUSIC, which is edited by Jim Fusilli (who has feet firmly planted in both fields as an authors author of detective fiction and a respected music critic for The Wall Street Journal), has compiled a very worthy volume consisting of 20 stories in which crime and music merge and intersect like the infamous crossroads where, so the story goes, bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play guitar. Warning: Please set aside enough time to finish reading CRIME PLUS MUSIC before you start it. You will want to read it all the way through in one sitting. There isn't a misstep in the bunch --- from the opener, The Last Temptation of Frankie Lymon by Peter Blauner, to Boy Wonder, Fusillis anthology closer. The placement could not have been by accident. Blauner is a popular music aficionado, and his story of the quick rise and hard fall of a popular doo-wop singer in the early days of rock n roll hews whisker-close to the truth. Fusilli contributes a tale using a cutting edge music genre as a backdrop. In Boy Wonder, a high school student becomes an overnight sensation --- literally --- in the EDM (electronic dance music) genre. It is a cautionary tale, as many of the stories here are, with this one about giving up what you want most for what you want now. You don't even have to be familiar with EDM to appreciate the story, or have it haunt you long after youve finished it. The stories bookended by the two described above maintain the quality with which CRIME PLUS MUSIC begins and ends. Many of them, as with Blauners tale, are extremely close to the real world. In The Blackbird by Peter Robinson, a Nick Drake-type singer-songwriter meets his true love and ironically pays a price for something he never bought. Those familiar with the story of The Runaways will see a somewhat parallel line within The Misfits by Naomi Rand, as she spins a tale of what might have been rather than what actually occurred. Meanwhile, Reed Farrel Colemans Look at Me/Dont Look at Me features a one- time radio star on the downside of his career who is about to makes a fateful choice. Those who were glued to the radio in the early 1960s will almost immediately recognize the subject of this story, though in the real world things worked out somewhat better. As far as the unreality goes, Gary Phillips offers up a slice of the supernatural in Shaderoc the Soul Shaker, wherein a once-great musician who hits a brick wall while composing a film soundtrack gets some hallucinatory help from an otherworldly source. Many of the stories in CRIME PLUS MUSIC find the music being used with bad or questionable intent. Earworms, from Zo Sharp, presents music being used as an instrument of torture or enhanced interrogation (depending on where you fall on the issue) before answering to the law of unintended consequences. A track by Beat Happening --- Me Untamed, which is also the title of David Liss fine contribution to this book --- provides an impetus to perform an act that would not be done otherwise, and, as we ultimately learn, more is the pity. Then there is Watching the Detectives by A.J. Hartley. This story is a bit different for Hartley but is an excellent tale nonetheless, concerning a serial killer inspired by the Elvis Costello song of the title. And then there is Played to Death by Bill Fitzhugh, wherein love of music collides with its commercialization, to bad but brilliant effect. Other stories defy instant classification, other than terrific. A couple are cousins, if you will, being stories that deal with similar topics in very different ways. 1968 Pelham Blue SG Jr. by Mark Haskell Smith deals with a problem similar to A Bus Ticket to Phoenix by Willy Vlautin (more on that title in a moment), as a bands instruments go missing after a gig and what is involved in getting them back. The stories also deal with life on the road; perhaps the protagonist of No Place Youre Likely to Find by Erica Wright should have read one or both of them before attempting a midlife career change as a traveling musician looking for a break but encountering something far different. My favorite story in CRIME PLUS MUSIC? I have a number of them, actually. First among equals would be the aforementioned A Bus Ticket to Phoenix, simply because of the manner in which Willy Vlautin --- the best writer youve probably never heard of --- nails the road-weary gestalt of a low-level touring backup band. All Ages by Alison Gaylin is a close second favorite --- and yes, depending on my mood, it nudges itself into first place --- about going to the funeral of a long-ago friend and the shared memory of a concert, and the dark events that occurred. NB: Listen to the album Los Angeles by X while you read this one. Oh, and then there is the absolutely wonderful The Long Black Veil by Val McDermid. The song by the same name is a crime novel told in a little over three minutes, with murder, mistaken identity, adultery and sacrifice comfortably in the mix. Listen to all three versions by Lefty Frizzell, Johnny Cash and The Band before you read McDermids story, which provides a couple of unexpected twists. While I love the song The Long Black Veil, I HATE Dr. Wu by Steely Dan. In fact, I almost skipped Are You With Me, Doctor Wu? by David Corbett. Missing this cryptic tale about a musician who gets a bad batch of heroin and a second, but not necessarily better, chance at life would have been a huge mistake. Similarly, I hate bagpipe music. Brendan DuBois wonderful tale, The Long Lament, hinges on bagpipes, but primarily concerns a long-absent son who returns home for his angry fathers death vigil. This story, perhaps more than any other in this collection, should become a novel. There are stories of equal quality that aren't immediately classifiable. Craig Johnson offers Unbalanced, a Walt Longmire story --- previously available in WAIT FOR SIGNS --- wherein the iconic lawman encounters a stranger on a cold night at a gas station, a meeting that leaves them both the better for it. Vincent Black Lightning by Tyler Dilts features Long Beach homicide detective Danny Beckett. You may not be entirely familiar with Dilts work, but I guarantee that this short tale of a bad life and a worse death will have you looking for his novels, as well as seeking out the Richard Thompson song after which this story is titled. And just when you think that Fusilli might run out of stories, he cajoles one from none other than Galadrielle Allman, whose musical heritage needs no introduction. Allman favors us with Only Women Bleed, a dark cautionary tale within an even darker coming-of-age vignette, one in which a musical game signals a beginning and an ending. I would be first in line to read a novel based on this story as well. Forgive me. I have gone on for far too long about CRIME PLUS MUSIC and could go on much longer. I actually could have summed it up fairly shortly and easily: Buy this book and read it, with your head stuck between some speakers and your favorite song collection amped to 11. Go for it.

As a result, there are as many futures as there are stories. Each story has its own `reality' and point of view. Future is unpredictable and unknown at best, and science fiction writers look beyond the world as we know it, into what lies beyond the horizon.

Mosier does an excellent job in conjoining mind, body, & soul w/ this very user-friendly book! I like the constant simplicity & flexibility through the entirety of this book.  \"Do what works for you\" she states.  You do not have to read this from cover to cover to grasp the punchlines of this book.  I found it pretty easy to jump into it here in there as I had time. I got the gist that the therapeutics are broken down into a few sections: stress relief/minimalization, diet, exercise.  I've been pretty diet/exercise conscious over my life & either learned something new or concurred w/ many of her pointers. The stress-relievers are great! It feels good to experience how a few deep breaths could feel, to turn something bad into something positive (or at least less negative), to just take a different approach & perspective? Some limits: Although NEJM & CDC are referenced here & there for stats, I thought that \"thoroughly researched\" was a bit of a stretch.  References used are not the strongest studies (ex: poorer study design, small sample size, few studies in general); probably not the best idea to support work. Recommended foods are listed.  Although she does provide recipes as examples, I think it would more beneficial to the reader to add portions, how much to eat, to prevent overeating. In the end, a 30-day calendar ties it all in, showing in fact, that this regimen is doable, and is a lifestyle, not just a one-time program to lose weight. In my end, I walked away w/ a LOT.  I learned to implement things to make my workouts REALLY count.  Like Holly, I've been working out this entire time & was really frustrated when I had started to gain weight in spite.  I learned ways to strategize my eating to curb cravings, but also maximize my nutrition.  I learned the why's of alot of my daily routine, i.e. the explanation of the benefits of the yoga poses that I've been practicing for the past few months!  And finally, I feel very good: much more energy, and well, happier (apparently this shows through the eyes of others)!  \"I can't complain,\" has been coming out of my mouth A LOT these past few weeks!

Some of the requirements are hard:  you must forgive parents or leaders that have caused harm in your life.  You must seek to live humbly.  You must renounce and destroy with no mercy those who come into contact with you that have a stronghold through the Jezebel spirit.  These are hard things to do.  To think to confront someone who appears to be so strong is intimidating at best.  Bill Vincent walks you through how to accomplish these hard tasks and to come out a better, more godly person who is only guided by the Holy Spirit and not influenced by a demon. I both like and disliked the narration.  I enjoyed the lilt and cadence of Paul Holbrook's voice but several times throughout the audiobook, he was obviously turning away from the microphone or doing something while he was speaking.

However, if like me you are looking for a book that is romantic yet believable while managing to capture and hold your worthy attention then respectfully pass quickly because this book is not a worthy read.  It's a burst in my opinion! The book started with very promising dialogue and i was instantly captivated.  However, once the beginning was explained, the book quickly took a nose dive for the worse!  I found the heroine tiresome - for a slave girl in that era she acted way superior to her station although she was well-born she's a slave nonetheless.  The story was told in all of about 8weeks if that!  The heroine was not only outspoken but the fierce warrior who purchased her radically became a powerless wanna-be warrior whom i came to dislike for his weakness.  We were told the heroine feared the hero from the outset but we never see his fierceness especially being controlled by a slave girl; it also seems he could not even control his intended bride. I grew to realy dislike the book as the dialogue became weaker and weaker as the pages progressed. To make matters worse the hero did not act in anyway like a viking!  It was really sad to see the book lack proper direction save to the one conclusive end - the reuniting with the heroine's family which is a mean feat to say the least.  Back in the viking days it was near impossible to chart maps much less chart the slave girl's settlement back to where she was abducted.  The story was way too soppy for my liking and as such i found the hero way too effeminate especially for a viking!  The book never really took off for me and it was a sad disaapointment!

Loved Tavia the main character, loved the characterisation in general which was very clever as here the story deals with werewolves and the author has created her own set of rules and social norms for the pack that made sense despite the fact that she is dealing with creatures of myth and fantasy that have been written about so many times, it is tricky.  However here she creates a world where it is easy to become engrossed in the plot and happily suspend belief to enjoy the story. There are some long passages of narrative which can be difficult to get right in order to maintain momentum but the book was perfectly balanced for me.  I read it in two sittings lounging in the sun and it is a testament to the writer that I raced through the book so fast. Perhaps the most important thing from my perspective are the characters.  I have to be engaged with the characters as an absolute and Sallyann Phillips really knows how to create believable characters that I could picture perfectly and in Tavia she has made a nicely imperfect, well rounded heroine that I completely got.  Nice twist on a well used genre, good use of language, a pacey tale with more than enough going on to keep those pages turning.  I really enjoyed this one.

Little do we know from those early pages just how good the story gets, and just how talented a writer Lion truly is. It's easy to write a book about a robbery, just as it's easy to write a screenplay about a heist; plenty of people have done it, and many have done it badly. However, thanks to his extensive knowledge of history, detailed research into Prague and the Holy Roman Empire to make the entire premise seem authentic, and the rich character development that never seems to end, Lion managed to capture my interest from start to finish. Each player in this heist has their own mysterious past, as does their benefactor/boss, and as we begin to see the true colors and motivations appear as the book unfolds, we begin to feel the tension build. There is so much build up that I was worried for a time that the pay off wouldn't quite deliver, but the disparate ends of this complicated knot all end up being tied together in a staggering story that I'll be recommending to people for a long time. It is an impressive achievement, and a testament to not only Lion's skill as a writer, but his dedication to the craft. Painting the settings in such tangible, enjoyable ways is a challenge in itself, but to populate it with fascinating characters and a complex, engaging plot is nothing short of brilliant.

The very beginning started off on a Harry Potter-like note. But after that, the story did feel like it dragged and read like any other high school drama, until the point where they investigated the old school house. As a paranormal fan, I really wanted more paranormal from it, but even at the end, it felt like most everything that happened in it (except for the ghost images) ended up having real world explanations. But, don't get me wrong, it did suck me in at the point of Tashas accident. I suddenly found I couldn't put it down and sped toward the end trying to figure out if there was anything truly paranormal about Ben, or if Chira might gain some powers, or if the ghosts really were trying to kill people. Ben was marvelously interesting and intriguing (and seemed more than a little like an older Harry Potter with his messy dark hair, striking eyes, owl companion, and mystical upbringing) and I loved Matt being in it as an example of a normal teenage boy in the exact same situation, so I adored the moments of the two of them together. I do hope we see further installments of this series and see Ben and Chiras relationship brow and dig more into who Ben is. (And like one of the other readers, Chiras name drive me a bit nuts trying to figure out how to pronounce correctly. Im guessing its probably supposed to be pronounced as Kaira though I was wavering on calling her Keera).</td><td>Not much Paranormal to be had here</td><td>1.450224E9</td><td>2015-12-16</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>2014-11-16</td><td>395</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>267</td><td>1457</td><td>0.17443486590038315</td></tr><tr><td>67008815</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3MWX4KR9AIAMT</td><td>B0006EXI54</td><td>Leta Hershey</td><td>Good story.

Bob is a hapless young man who died in a tragic rose-trimming accident, was raised to zombie-hood by his grieving mother, who then couldn't handle his actual zombie condition. In the sequel, Bob has adjusted fairly well to his condition, and hes found a horde (read: family and friends) to live with. We meet one of them, Face, and get to know him pretty well. The plot  involves terrorists, double-crosses, supernatural politics, and intra-species relations. Humour abounds. This book made me laugh out loud a half-dozen times and smile throughout. Being the obsessive editor-type that I am, I cannot avoid remarking that there are a few (very few) rough patches. A couple of missing words. The occasional comma splice. The word site used when sight was intended. Did that dim my enjoyment? Nope. One thing I would say is that the conclusion of the major plot line was a little . . . sketchy, maybe. I wanted a little more development of the big plot twist at the end. I recommend this novella.

Do you like to dig in the dirt? The author, Eva B. Kids, brings us another wonderful adventure with her three friends, Alexander the pig, the daredevil; Mycroft the zebra, the brainy one; and Pim Hedgehog, the timid one. They live near the Little Green a Forest in a lovely little town. One day, Alexander who was always looking for adventures, thought it would be a good idea to look for dinosaurs. Pim had no idea what he was talking about but reluctantly went along. Mycroft was always up for a good adventure. Digging dirt is a difficult job, but Alexander had an electric jackhammer that was quite the thing. Alexander loved to eat, so he packed up a very big lunch in a sack, and off they went. Also along the way they ran into the smelly Walter Wolf, you could tell him a mile off because of his farts. He was always looking for Sally the sheep, who was always trying to avoid Walter. Anyway, they were off, and Alexander started digging with his jackhammer, and made a big discovery. When you read this book you will discover what occurs. Parents/teachers will enjoy reading this book to their children. The children will love the characters in this book because they can identify with the different characters. Alexander the pig loves food and fun, Mycroft is very smart, and Pim is very timid, but all are very nice characters. Walter the farting wolf will make them laugh, and Sally the sheep is a fun character trying to hide from Walter. The illustrations are bright, vivid and colorful. They depict the adventures of all of these characters. This is such a wonderful storyline, and my granddaughter and I love reading these stories.

What she was particularly pleased about was that the text and illustrations were botanically correct. The story is not that memorable, but I think Nancy's greater intention was to inculcate in her children, and the children of others, an appreciation and understanding of the flowers frequently found in home gardens. The verses were written in a pleasing meter with clever rhymes. I think she autographed my copy, but somewhere over the years the book disappeared from our children's otherwise carefully saved collection of books still being enjoyed today by our grandchildren. Wish the volume were not now so rare - and therefore expensive! To my knowledge, Nancy did not write any more books. Sadly, she died quite young, of a cancer that had invaded her spine. A tragic loss to her family, and to those who might have enjoyed more of her books.

They've summoned enough fallen angels and found enough mortal hosts. And now they're turning civilians against their own government.

The writing and descriptions are clear. Someone with formal NLP training will appreciate some of the nuances of the hypnotic language it's being used. The visual squash is used when there is a conflict. For example, a person wants to lose weight, but they are unable to greatly reduce the amount of sugary foods that their eating. Visual squash sets up a negotiation between the two competing impulses, or parts. The basic premise being that both sides have a positive intention, even if there are undesirable consequences to one of the parts behaviors. As a hypnotherapist and NLP practitioner I've been using the visual squash since 1990 and have found it to be extremely powerful and effective.

While I am quite accustomed to Amazon's male robot's speech patterns, I did find the endless give and take between the police officer on the case and Stanley Hastings to be trying. None the less, the good humor and well-drawn central characters saved the day. Stanley and Alice, husband and wife, make a fine team and there are a number of other well-done characterizations. Stanley, though far from being in the mold of Philo Vance or young Ellery Queen, has been put into a book modeled on those in which they exercised their superior intellectual gifts. Hall makes the style work for him, not without necessary modification. Alice and Stanley have driven their son to his summer camp in New England and intend a second honeymoon before resuming normal preoccupations. Stopping at an Inn they are plunged almost immediately into a case of murder which Stanley despairs seeing the local police unravel. If no innocent person is to be assigned responsibility for the crime, Stanley feels he must take a hand. The result is an entertaining, though sometimes talky, book. I think it will please the average cozy reader.</td><td>COZY, INDEED; HUMOROUS AND VERY TALKY.</td><td>1.343088E9</td><td>2012-07-24</td><td>18</td><td>1</td><td>2011-09-22</td><td>306</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>198</td><td>1164</td><td>0.1043181818181818</td></tr><tr><td>67016819</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3IE26B39T3L0F</td><td>2080135635</td><td>Ann G.

But there is no doubt that the profession has stamped its mark on him, as a career, and as a writer, and as a family man. Golding's novels are full of people learning unexpectedly - tricks of survival, how to remove seaweed from a ship's keel - and he reveals here how his success as a novelist from the bestselling Lord of the Flies - aiming to free him from the classroom, actually meant that for ever more he was chained to the cult of pedagogy as he had to explain the book on tours for the rest of his life. This essay collection is full of unexpected charms from Golding who writes of his learning experiences at home from his parents and in his family garden, in Greece as he pursues the scene of the battle of Thermopolye, and some little jibes as he takes to task the miserable mass market culture of the American creative writing class.

Let me start off by saying that I wasn't sure how to feel about a Christian romance and I can honestly say I don't know if I've ever read one. Well this book is so well done, please do not let the genre detour you from reading this, it was a beautiful story. I believe we all find our own ways to heal and more than it being God or our heroine's (Calla) beliefs she needed to find strength within herself too. The element of Christianity is there but it's subtle and not thrown in your face. I loved the innocence of the characters too. You don't find that too much in a romance novel, especially with the men, so it was a nice change of pace. I found this book to be very emotional, I'll write a little about it. Calla (h) is trying to move on but can't, she has lost faith in herself and God and can't heal. While in college her roommate drags her out and she runs into the one person she never thought she would see or talk to again Beck (H). He was her best friend but it was all lost because of one event, and that event destroyed everything. I thought this book was going to be a love triangle but it wasn't and the best thing about the story to me was seeing both the H and h heal. It wasn't instantaneous and they wanted to heal each other. They were sad, hurt and angry but wanted to help each other overcome it. There was a huge element of surprise in this book...WOW I was not expecting it and it left me in tears. I remember exactly when I read it too because I was on my treadmill and had to stop my work out to compose myself. I loved the secondary characters and  I think you will fall in love with Calla's friend Parker, he may have been my favorite. This was a wonderful book it made me think and made me very emotional. This is more than a  romance, it is about faith, trust, and finding yourself. I won't say healing because I think I've written that enough. ;) Don't expect steamy sex scenes because this book isn't that type of story. I highly recommend.</td><td>A bittersweet story that left me in tears.

Dee's reputation, whether held in admiration or in scorn, is known.  As scientific adviser to Elizabeth I of England and an intimate associate of Sir Philip Sidney, Dee had a non-negligible, though not always profound, influence on English political decision making in his day. What the present volume presents are diary entries.  They will be of value to the Dee scholar who, attempting to reconstruct the context in which Dee operated, will find value in the seeming minutia contained in the diary.  As an example, consider the entry 3 July 1582 where Dee describes an incident of his son falling down and cutting his head above his right eyebrow.  Given the medical knowledge of the day, such an observation could herald the death or blindness of Dee's son. This book will be of little interest to the average reader who is seeking a Dee biography.  To the student of medieval, Renaissance, scientific, English, and medical histories, the work will contain gems of inestimable value.</td><td>It is what it is</td><td>1.350864E9</td><td>2012-10-22</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>205</td><td>1197</td><td>-0.06578373015873015</td></tr><tr><td>67023364</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AIYLXC2Y5I8ER</td><td>1500675563</td><td>TotallyBookedBlog</td><td>Review for the Trilogy - no spoilers. Give us a chance, Vivian. Run to me. So far we have A.D.O.R.E.D this series! The dialogue, banter, romance, angst, passion, emotion and drama left us breathless not to mention our brand newbe still our beating hearts book boyfriend left us swooooning! Seriously, Keaton Thorne is the best!. Yes, were air quoting  Keaton, so get over it buddy! Its just a story, V. We all have a story. We received an email from a reader who told us to drop everything and read this book! She thought it was right up our ally and she was right! We ran the gauntlet of emotions; we laughed out loud, we welled up, did some serious swooning over Keaton, met a new author whose work were giddy over, and we loved every minute! I thought of the collection of New Adult books that were lined up on my Kindle, wondering if his pulse was thundering and his dick was twitching. Kimberly Stedronsky told her story with a perfect balance of realism, passion, drama and humour which had us feverishly turning the pages. The expressive way in which she delivered the humour in this story ensured we read it with a huge smile on our faces as we feverishly devoured every word! You have too much time of your hands. I have too much Vivian on my hands. The prologue had a sudden impact, which drew us into the story, leaving us pondering how Vivan had arrived at that point in her life. Just what had transpired up to and after that point? Well, Kimberly Stedronsky deliciously drip fed us tiny morsels of her story to keep us tantalisingly teased! Keaton Thorne! Wow!!! WE. ARE. IN. LOVE with this flawed and bloody gorgeous man!!  He was the complete book boyfriend. Good looking, sexy, strong, smart, charismatic, possessing a wonderful sarcastic wit and an enigmatic presence. Yep, hes the stuff book boyfriends are made of and we couldn't get enough of him. We think we fell more and more in love with him as the story progressed. He could definitely cause a city to heat and you really do need to meet this guy any which way you can. But you're everything. Youre everything that I used to pretend existed out there for me., somewhere. Youre the beautiful girl who I would dream about when Id lie awake at night, the one whod make me laugh, p**s me off, and impress me, all at the same ****ing time.  Normally were not fans of bringing real life into our books but this author handled it in such a way that it enhanced the story. The movie and book references were so much funwell, everything was. As you can tell, we really did love it. We initially adored Vivian and found ourselves empathising with her. Whilst we may have become exasperated by some of her actions and reasoning, we felt as though we understood her. It was who she was and how she handled difficult situations. She was a little reckless and a lot impetuous, but her heart was in the right place. By book two it was a different story and we wanted to throttle her. Her thought process, her flip flopping drove us to the brink and she somehow even managed to bring Keaton down which upset us deeply. Thankfully, Kimberly Stedronsky pulled it back and had us once again connecting with Vivian. It was a close call, the angst was aplenty, and we were walking a tightrope of going off this character completely but luckily that wasn't the case. Told in a dual POV between Keaton and Vivian, it was a delight to get an insight into their inner thoughts which were hilarious. Their banter was priceless. We were reciting many classic lines whilst discussing the books after finishing. In fact, were still giggling and swooning! She was gorgeous. Stunning. She took my breath away and gave me air to breathe. It would be a true crime not to pick up this series. Its fun, flirty, angsty, emotional and addictive and you get to meet the delectable Mr Keaton Thorne!!! Yummy!! He needed me.  I needed him. Right? Isnt this the way it goes? Isnt this our blockbuster? I needed him to unbreak my heart, and he needed me to save him. For a fistful of dollars you can pick up and fall in love with Below Unforgiven, or for a few dollars more, you can grab the series! Either way, you need to get a hold of these books any which way you can because it would be a true crime to pass these up. Everyone in town introduced themselves by name and relations. Apparently, I was no exception. Maybe it was a precautionary measure to thwart inbreeding. A real winner! The goodthere was LOTS of that! The badwell, there wasn't really any bad, except wanting to throw our Kindles once or twice..and the ugly..hmmm there wasn't any of that either, but we had to get that Clint Eastwood title in here somewhere. An absolute recommend from us!!! Were still on book cloud nine from this one! Enjoy but rememberKeaton is ours!!! On a side note, weve been asked if its worth reading the novella or delving straight into books one and two  we say  absolutely read the novella. It reaches further into the characters and gives you a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the relationships. It really is an added bonus to the series we wouldnt have missed!</td><td>Keaton Thorne is the best! </td><td>1.4218848E9</td><td>2015-01-22</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>930</td><td>5104</td><td>0.24773538713270854</td></tr><tr><td>67023803</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>ALCG0XY7P0BQT</td><td>1475274068</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>The book was okay.

As with the first book, I was drawn in from page 1. The characters are carefully and realistically constructed and the story moves at a really good pace. The twists and turns are better than a roller coaster ride. This book's main protagonist is a gay teenager who is befriended by River, well-remembered from the first book. The boy is the victim of bullying because of his sexual orientation. Even his mother bullies and berates him, delivering the lowest possible blows. I don't want to give away too much of the plot. The beginning of the revitalization of the town we read about in Book One is riveting. The dialogue is realistic.

These are relatively short books (about 95 pages) of which less than half consists of text. Hence if one is looking for a scholarly in-depth tome on the subject this is not the book. In addition, unlike nearly all books in this series this book was not originally commissioned by as part of Taschens Basic Art series. Instead it was previously published by Thames and Hudson in 1973. The book also, unlike most Taschen Basic Art series book, lacks a blurb on who the author and his qualifications (professor of art history?). Despite the books short length it still provides a decent introduction to those with little to no knowledge of Bosch. His main paintings are discussed in terms of contemporary cultural, religions and  historical meaning. The author is very knowledgeable of both the paintings and the history and culture of the times. Hence it seems safe to say that he is a professor of art history specializing in the time and region. He provides very good perspective on the paintings to those without a very in-depth understanding of their historical, cultural or religious contexts. In addition, the color illustrations in the book are quite good. They are definitely not of the quality one would find in fine museum quality books. Then again this book only costs about $10 and for that price range these illustrations, as can be expected from a Taschen publication are unsurpassed. Unfortunately the book does have some weaknesses that prevent this reviewer from granting the book either a four or five star rating (typically what books in this series rate as in this reviewers experience). One problem is that the book does not provide even a rudimentary biography of the man. Hence it is not possible for the reader to gauge how the works may have fitted into the artists life. There is also no comparison or analysis of Boschs work with contemporary artists or styles. Was there any artist or school that influenced him or did his works reflect a complete break with any styles at that time or up to that point? This question goes unanswered. The author also does not address the issue of whether or not Bosch suffered from any type of mental illness or abnormality that may have lead him to create the images he did. Also, because the book tries to cram so many of Boschs extensive works into such a small space, many of the illustrations are quite small (only thumb sized) and hence impossible to make out. This is particularly the case with respect to his many, many etchings. In addition, much of the text is not near the illustrations discussed. This forces the reader to search through the book to find the illustrations being referred to through the text. Last but not least there is no analysis of Boschs style per se. For all these reasons this reviewer feels that this book is only worthy of a 3 star rating. Nevertheless still a decent introduction to those not familiar with the artist.</td><td>A very succinct introduction to the author but with some problems</td><td>1.4275872E9</td><td>2015-03-29</td><td>30</td><td>4</td><td>2015-03-21</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>530</td><td>3036</td><td>0.07013157894736842</td></tr><tr><td>67024794</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AUSLDE6RFBM2O</td><td>B002NESNX2</td><td>Mike E.

I am willing to let a lot slide with a good storyline, which is why I am giving this three stars, but the overabundance of poor grammar, sentence fragments and missued or misspelled words took me away from the story too many times to give it any higher rating. It does end on a major cliffhanger, but knowing it was the first book in a series going into it, I really do not have a problem with that, and I truly am curious to see where that takes the next book.  But at this point, between the state of the first book and the cost of the sequel, I am going to have to pass at the moment.

Leahy and others in the military and government expressed depressed disgust over the use of nuclear weapons against civilians, and Capt. Robert Lewis (co-pilot of the Enola Gay) later met with a group of the Hiroshima Maidens in the U.S. to express his regret and donate money for their medical costs. \"Letters from the End of the World\", along with \"Hiroshima Diary,\" present the attack on Hiroshima in terms of the human cost and suffering of civilians. More lives were lost in the fire bombings of Japanese cities and the destruction of Dresden but both the immediate and long-term effects of the use of nuclear weapons constitute a horrific act. We now know that the use of violence against civilian populations tends to strengthen a resolve to fight to the bitter end. Yet, it remains a tactic by some and an accepted consequence by most. The use of nuclear weapons against Japan were not the deciding factor in ending the war. It was already over. As long as governments and citizens choose to accept the slaughter of civilians as a collateral consequence to conflict, atrocities will continue. Self-satisfied, unexamined clucking about the unfortunate inevitability of civilian deaths in war is a moral crime in itself. Especially since the 20th century heralded in an age of increasing civilian death tolls in all conflicts. Capt. Paul Tibbets (pilot of the Enola Gay) went to his grave with no regrets about Hiroshima. To his credit, he met with at least one hibakusha (disfigured survivor of the attack). Tibbets rightly stated that all war is immoral and leads to immoral action. We'd better find a different way to settle differences. Hiroshima today is a gleaming, modern city that somewhat mutes even a visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome. Even the memorial museum does not convey the horror of August 6th, 1945 the way the witness testimonies do.

Such sadness that the children who came to Katie and  Kirk Childers ranch, suffered.  It was good to see that while they couldn't keep each child who passes through their home (even though they wanted to) they could at least give them regular meals, a safe place to live, love, kindness and stability and most of all introduce them to Jesus.  All of these things that didn't have much of before.  Its not a heavy Jesus theme, they lived it more than pushed it in the story. I wasn't totally sure that I would like this book, but in many of the cases it was about Redemption stories of each child, and what the Childers went through as they loved them.  Its kind of hard to describe other than what has already been said on other reviews.  Many of the other reviews give you the basics of the story, so I am adding my feeling about it too.  Its engaging and heartbreaking without being another Oliver Twist kind of story.

Papoutsis</td><td>First off I want to say that the 28th Edition of the Novum Testamentum Graece is simply a tour de force of modern biblical criticism. The scholarship, up to date New testament fragments, New Testament papryi fragments, rich and full citations of New Testament passages from the Fathers of the Church, etc., make the 28th Edition of the Greek New Testament not only incredible due to its immence scholarship and fidelity to true textual criticism, but also because it includes the fullest extent possible of ALL Greek New Testament witnesses, biblical codicies, citation in the writings of the Church Fathers, liturgical lectionary readings, and up to date discoveries of new Greek New testament papryi fragments found in the Middle East. Further, the 28th edition of the Nestle-Aland Greek New testament makes about 30 updates to the base text of the Catholic Epistles Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior: Volume !V: Catholic Letters (Parts 1 & 2) (Greek Edition), while simplifying the bracket structure and updating the apparatus with some of the newer manuscript research that was used in the Editio Critica Maior. These updates represent minor, but useful, changes from the 27th edition. Further, the change that occured in Jude 5 is simply put amazing and confirms the earliest of Greek New Testament texts. In the 27th Edition of the Greek New Testament the reading was: \"Now I desire to remind you, though you were once for all fully informed, that he who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.\" The 28th Edition of the Greek New Testament at Jude reads: \"Now I desire to remind you, though you were once for all fully informed, that Jesus saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.\" This is incredible! The 28th Edition of the Greek New Testament has made the textual decision that the \"ORIGINAL\" reading of Jude 5 said that JESUS saved the children of Israel of the land of Egypt. This is a direct and clear reference to the early Christian Belief of equating Jesus with God! that Jesus was God! People should not miss this as this is a profound theological statement not only reflected in the Jude 5, but reflecting a very early Christian belief. From here on out many a Modernist theologian will have a hard time explaining away how the Early Christians, as reflected in Jude 5, equated Jesus with God as just being one of many sects of Christianties. According to Jude 5 in the 28th Edition of the Greek New testament it was NOT just another sectarian Christian belief that Jesus was God, but the MAIN Christian belief that Jesus was God. Pick-up the 28th edition of the Greek New testament, dive into it and study it as much as you can. I know I am and I love it, and I know you will love it as well. Peter A.

First of all, I was surprised at how clear the sound of the performance actually was, considering the date of the recording. Second, I've seen and heard numerous performances of Shakespeare's Hamlet over the years, (including Mel Gibson, Nicol Williamson, Lawrence Oliver, Richard Burton, and Kenneth Branagh), most of which I have enjoyed, more or less, for different reasons.  (I find it is a lot like listening to the many, great violinists who have recorded Beethoven's, one and only, Violin Concerto in D, Op. 61, i.e., some are good and some are great, for different reasons.)   At the time of this recording, John Gielgud had played Hamlet over 500 times and this performance in 1948 came late for him to play the role, yet Gielgud was also at the height of his abilities as an actor.  I found that beyond the various interpretation's of Hamlet's personality by others, no one can \"Speak the speech, I pray you, ...trippingly on the tongue...\" in the decisively commanding, poetic, and eloquent manner as John Gielgud.  It is the beauty of Shakespeare's language that Gielgud offers here, and that I believe is worth the price of admission, (or in this case, the 3CDs).  Of course, the cast is not perfect, but Andrew Cruickshank is the best Claudius, I've ever heard, and Hugh Griffith's monologue as the First Player is just marvelous.  Also, memorable is Marian Spencer as Gertrude, Baliol Holloway as Polonius, Sebastian Shaw as Horatio and Hugh Burden as Laertes.  If that's not enough to wet your palette, get this CD set for no other reason than it is a historic performance of a John Gielgud with an enchanted voice, like none other.</td><td>Excellent Historic Recording</td><td>1.1752128E9</td><td>2007-03-30</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>311</td><td>1776</td><td>0.1734953703703704</td></tr><tr><td>67028396</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A3K19JM4OS7RLF</td><td>B00S9S4NGC</td><td>Diana Martin</td><td>For a first attempt, it was ok.  I liked the character development and the pace of the story. It is clear that the author, being a former policeman, is familiar with the background of this type of crime and is able to bring that personal perspective into the story in a way that feels real, however, simple glaring editing issues constantly pull the reader out of the story.

I am a fan of her writing and thought this book was similar to some of her stuff. I have been going through a cowboy phase in my reading! Go figure. I go through some weird phases. Lexi is dating Joel, the town bad boy, when her mother puts her foot down and decides to send her to her grandparents farm. There she is to spend the entire summer working and have no contact with her boyfriend. While there she befriends Landon, the cowboy. Lexi struggles with not having contact with Joel and her developing feelings for Landon. By the end of the summer Lexi's world is coming apart. I enjoyed this book. At first I was worried that it would be a cheesy instant love story, but it wasn't. It is definitely a love story, but it also is about Lexi discovering who she wants to be and what she wants out of life. Plus its got the classic good boy versus bad boy debate in it! My one complaint is repetitiveness. Alexandria would think something in her head. Then repeat the exact same thing out loud. This annoys me cause I am forced to read the same thing twice. I only need to hear something once! But that was my only complaint. I enjoyed this book and it was a quick read I ended up finishing over the course of a few hours for 2 nights.

The next day I broke my own rule about not reading during the day. I quickly did what I had too around the house and on social media, and then I grabbed my kindle and settled into this fast paced, exciting thriller, until it was done. I love Vigilante booksand Colin Bailey (The Phoenix) captured me immediately.  Truthfully, there are times in real life when I think the world could use groups like the Olympus Project to rid society of some of its festering sores. (and they probably do exist!) This book had it all for meexcitement, drama, suspense, intrigue, sex, filled with great dialogue and rich description.  I really enjoyed the way very pertinent modern day social issues were woven into the plot, and the results were not sanitized. They were tragic, just as they would be in real life, and for me it added to the authenticity of the story.  I sometimes had to remind myself that this was simply great fiction! Ted Tayler has become the latest favorite author on my list, and I will be reading more of his works. I immediately downloaded Conception.

I am upset that this was a short. I cannot wait to read the next one. I fell in love with the characters, especially Mia. She was detailed very well for my imagination to take over. I could not relate to her, but that did not affect the way I felt about her. Instead of being my best friend, she was just a co-worker feeling for another co-worker. Detached but affected by the outcome. Deacon is a different matter. He is not as defined as Mia and that is reasonable due to this being Mias story. The story line mostly stayed at the same pace with some high points. It was not action packed but that would be asking to much for a 94 page story. The settings were vivid and I started to think those monsters were coming after me. There were some twists that made the characters grow into themselves. The dialogue was just the right amount for the characters not sure of themselves. I wish I could get excited about this short, but it being this length, it was hard. It was great for a lazy slow day to sit and read at one time. 4 stars I was given a free copy in exchange for an honest review. Quote: I thought I lost you, he said as a small tear slid from his eye.

Blackmer</td><td>If you loved `Seithe' you need to read Indigo Vamporium. Sometimes a prequel seems like just an add-on story, one that we're really not very interesting in hearing. Not so with this one. In this YA novel we learn about the early years of several characters we first met in some of Poppet's other books from the Pravus series. It's fun to see some of our favorites in their younger days, but this is primarily Seithe's story. Visiting Cape town South Africa under the watchful eye of their uncle Venix, we meet Darise, Seithe, Ellindt and Jowendrhan as teenage vampyres, struggling to learn who they are and how they fit in to the bigger world. Growing up is always complicated, but for Seithe it often seems unbearable. Still mourning the loss of his mortal mother, he meets Tasmin, a local girl. As they are drawn together, life is finally starting to seem a little more worthwhile. But life is never as simple as it we want it. Seithe's oldest brother Darise isn't interested in being an example for his siblings, and so Seithe shoulders that responsibility, watching out for his twin sister Ellindt, and youngest brother Jowendrhan. Venix, himself a powerful angel, offers only tough love and no emotional support, constantly pushing Seithe to realize his power and potential, leaving his young charge ragged and emotionally spent; filled with supernatural anguish powerful enough to even affect the larger physical world around him. As Seithe goes through his rite of passage, there are many dangers; some to face alone, and some which threaten those he loves. Though this story is perfect for YA, its appeal goes beyond that genre. This is a story of family, first love, courage, coming of age and discovering that perhaps our only limitations are those we put upon ourselves. And finally, as we see Poppet blend legend and myth together so seamlessly, we realize in the battle between light and darkness, truth can be found in many places.

So much of her life was saved for posterity, and each piece displayed here was not just saved because it was her's, but because of a story associated with it, mainly about other famous people who called Grace \"friend\". The photography is spectacular. This museum quality book contains the most photographs of Grace grouped together between two covers than I have ever seen before, along with some pictures that I had not seen before. The print production values are practically perfect. This is a sturdy piece, constructed to stand the test of time, something Grace Kelly is very likely to easily achieve. She helped modernize Hollywood's idea of what a smart, educated, beautiful, blond, classy lady was. This is a book about a movie star famous for a smoking, sensual sexuality, who reinvented herself in a way not even attainable to a Madonna by marrying a prince, and becoming herself a princess. Together, Rainier and Grace brought a kingdom caught in the grip of decay, decadence, nearly bankrupt, and turned the whole thing around - all before she died at a very early age.</td><td>A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever</td><td>1.235952E9</td><td>2009-03-02</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>211</td><td>1218</td><td>0.3904887218045112</td></tr><tr><td>67030411</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>APKOADNA028C</td><td>1573442585</td><td>L.

Margaret is let down badly by her fiance after he comes back from a business trip and finishes their relationship after admitting to an affair with the woman waiting in the car outside.  Once Margaret is over the shock she realises he wasn't much of a lover or a loss anyway but it still doesnt get rid of her urge to have a child before it is too late.  When her employer offers her a short contract in France she leaps at the chance of a breath of fresher air.  Little did she realise it was going to be the start of an affair which would have such consequences for her dreams. I don't normally feel sorry for women who do the sort of thing Margaret does but I warmed to this character and felt every ounce of her pain as she went through one crisis and in to another.  Faith Mortimer really has the knack of a good storyteller and this novel actually got me a bit teary in the end as I felt so involved with Margarets story.</td><td>Emotive and a great read</td><td>1.3995072E9</td><td>2014-05-08</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2014-02-27</td><td>70</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>191</td><td>963</td><td>0.006684027777777782</td></tr><tr><td>67032987</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A2WIBUO15IY4M</td><td>1440583633</td><td>Ally Swanson</td><td>The author uses an unfortunate act of mother nature to bring two unlikely strangers together.

This book was edited by Joanne Cubbs and Eugene W. Metcalf.  It begins with a quote from the artist Thornton Dial, \"All truth is hard truth. We're in the darkness now, and we got to accept the hard truth to bring on the light. You can hide the truth, but you can't get rid of it. When truth comes out in the light, we get the beauty of the world.\" Going through this beautiful catalogue you are summon to acknowledge the raw hard truth of the artist. Several themes are found throughout Dial's work, they are the South influence, segregation, civil rights, and a voice that often unheard. Thornton Dial is not a man of letters and is illiterate, but that does not hold him back from creating a power message that reflects the important issues of our days from war, to race relations, to the inequity of our system. The noted scholar David C. Driskell writes a seminal piece after spending time with the artist. How his work does come from the African American tradition of yard art.  How he takes items that are discarded and reinvigorates them with a message. As he notes everything cycles back into the earth as well as we do. Joanne Cubbs takes a step future and ventures to categorize this artist in contemporary terms point to the symbolism from the tiger who weaves in out of being captures to move free. These pieces are quite large and are full of emotion and very powerful. They speak to tragedies as one labeled \"the last day of MLK\", a portrait of Christ last supper and the Crucifixion as a metaphor of Kings impeding death . Some very powerful works came ten years after a 60 Minutes television piece by reporter Safer entitled \"Tin Man\" that hurt Dial's career portray the anguish and struggle of the artist. George Tate also contributes an interesting written piece placing the artist in the context of musical and the dramatic rise of the Sun Ra out of Alabama.  Dial's year of his birth in 1928 brought to the world Warhol, Bo Diddle, Fats Domino to name a few. The book is beautifully broken in themes of struggles, old hardships, and creative spirit, false promises, creative spirit, and facing troubled times, and redemption. Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial is an encyclopedia of information and is an ideal addition to any library. The opportunity to celebrate the work of a man who shares the voice of the common people.

I also have the assurance of multiple psychiatrists and therapists that it happened because I have exhibited all the signs and behaviors of a victim of incest. I think my mother hated sex, (perhaps she was also abused) and \"gave\" me to my father. I also think it was hidden because of my family's religious beliefs. I believe the worst thing of all was that my mother never touched me, hugged me, or ever told me she loved me, so the attention he gave me,( disguised as love,) was worth the other things he did.

After reading this book I am convinced that as the title suggests studying Kabbalah with Rav Michael Laitman PhD is to be experienced not simply read about. In just twelve chapters Rav Laitman takes you through in-depth discovery of important concepts of authentic Kabbalah in easily absorbed language and phrases. The question and answer format is both simple and thorough which I found to be a very satisfying and informative way to learn. In The Kabbalah Experience Michael Laitman demonstrates an understanding of and love for his students, as well as the casual reader, which is reflected in the care and attention he has given to writing this book. A huge plus is the detailed table of contents which makes it so very easy to find any particular question or subject matter you are interested in finding quickly.

Did I say awesome? I read a lot and believe me, I've not read anything like this since I read Anne Rice novels back in the 90's. I originally read just the sample of this story on the Author's website. I was so intrigued that I bugged and bugged him for the full novel. It far exceeded my expectations and I had already had high hopes for it after the sample. Young Daniel finds out from his family that he is a Dhampir and the blood package he received in the mail further confirmed what he feared. He was adopted from his `mom's' sister, Celeste and his father was Dominus, Lord of the Shadow World. Daniel leaves his home and everyone he knows in search of his biological mother. After visiting Xochil, a shaman, he learns much of what he's going to need to know to battle to keep himself from succumbing to his fathers' twisted world. He meets a young paranormal investigator whose father was killed by Dominus and takes her along on his journey reluctantly. Read the story to follow his journey. Will he find his mother? Will he keep himself from the snares of his father? There's so much to this story that it will keep you guessing. The Author, Mark Knight, takes you on a twisting and turning journey with his main character. Just when you think you have things figured out and how much more could possibly happen, he adds another aspect to the story that sucks you in. He's created a world where you really feel like you are going through this journey with Daniel yourself and envelopes you in a world of insane, cunning and manipulative characters. He is an excellent storyteller and paints the picture so well for you that you can actually see it in your mind. His attention to detail and creativity is leaps and bounds beyond anything I've ever read. The story is simply creative, well thought out and just crazy good! It is a must read for anyone who loves paranormal, mind blowing, dark fantasy. I just can't say enough to give this book its proper justice. If this were a movie, which it would be awesome if taken on, it would break all the blockbuster records out there and win all the Oscars if the right people were cast. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest, it is a 100! If there was a grade above an A+, it would be used for this book! You will not be disappointed with this book.

Instead, Fox Lees book, which by all accounts, is the beginning of what promises to be an epic series of Armageddon sized proportions, eschews standard zombie fare to become a melange of action, thrills and terror that also happens to be occurring right in the centre of a zombie apocalypse. At the heart of it, detailed in a brief prologue and a couple of gruesome and intricately introductory chapters a sinister parasitic entity feeds upon all the terrible sorrows and travails which are experienced by humanity, an entity that has travelled through the mists of time warping the minds of men to do evil bidding, both Vlad the Impaler and Adolf Hitler recounted as prime examples. Fast forward some seventy odd years later and unusually lucky ladiesman Quinn OBrien is out enjoying an evening drinking with his buddies, checking out girls. After meeting the feisty Hope, Quinn later discovers in her company why it is he has always been so lucky, with a mysterious old fellow spinning him a tale about him being in possession of the Shine. And while the Shine is the Light, the good within the world, there too exists the Shadow, the Dark Veil. Thus, the universes of these two random souls are completely turned upside down as they enter a world they would believe possible. Into The Darkness has a broad scope, encompassing a wide array of characters, landscapes and situations and with such a vast array of character developments and storylines unfolding, this could have fallen into a state of disarray or confusion, but in the deft hands of Lee, the complexities which crop up are handled with aplomb and plots are neatly linked throughout. This tale pits good against evil with great results and memorable villains-Zorn is truly a standout-and to top off all of these engaging plots and subplots, and wonderfully realised characters, the author drops in bucketloads of flesh chomping zombies and the scene is truly set for horrendous apocalypse. There are taut thrills, myriad bursts of action, and loads of undead horror and even spots of romance woven all together to create this captivating piece and its a wonderful stage setter for the ensuing series. Once you read this one, youll be hanging out for the next episode of the Legend of Shadow and Light.</td><td>A unique undead experience</td><td>1.3961376E9</td><td>2014-03-30</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>414</td><td>2430</td><td>0.12157953761214631</td></tr><tr><td>67038102</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A2U85N2BQ1T000</td><td>B000MRHK36</td><td>nena</td><td>Wonderful books with some history and I have read the entire series; 25 or 30 books?</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1.47096E9</td><td>2016-08-12</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2014-11-30</td><td>621</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>16</td><td>84</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>67038242</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A2AD30WQN0O3D0</td><td>B00W3TSUYY</td><td>Lexi</td><td>Decent Read.

I'd give her 5 stars, even if the book was mediocre, but thankfully that is not the case. I thought the characters were well developed; I liked that the h was her own person, independent of the H.  There's nothing I despise more than a female character that can't function without the male in the story.

The code itself is a distress call for help. Once inside her twin's apartment Justine discovers that her twin isn't the model she always thought she was but is instead a high paid escort to the uber wealthy. In order to find her sister, Justine assumes the role of Jillian, hoping to find clues along the way to help her discover Jillian's whereabouts. She never expected to like the role of Jillian so much. She meets Doug Rawls, a powerful man that sexually attracts her like no other. The only problem is, Doug could be instrumental in helping her find her sister, or he could be an enemy that will see to the demise of both sisters for good. Having read books by Thea Devine before, I truly thought I'd devour this book as well. Sad to say, it was really difficult to get into the story as it was highly unbelievable. Justine just discovers her sister is missing, and although she tells herself as a mantra to do whatever is necessary, she almost immediately falls into bed with a stranger.  At first one might consider that she's thinking fast on her feet, but Justine so easily falls into the role of escort, even though she's a mild mannered research scientist. And as she assumes her twin's role, if she thinks about Jillian at all, it's certainly not the focus of her thoughts. Instead her priorities seem to be about sex alone! The \"hero\" of the story, Doug, is such a jerk that it's impossible to like him. He's not dominant but domineering. He's overbearing, rude and throughout the story really doesn't seem to have Justine's feelings in mind at all. While he may be physically attractive, after a while I couldn't recall his looks as his dreadful personality took over. As one can imagine as an escort, Justine had to deal with quite a bit of men. So there are a variety of personalities and characters. However, every single character in the story calls the genitalia the same terms. What was so distracting is that they all call the male genitalia the proper anatomical terms, but the female genitalia is called what many consider a rather crass term, so it's rather incongruous. Since those terms are used so frequently in an erotic romance, it got so distracting, I didn't want to finish the book! Speaking of endings, erotic romances should have a HEA. Always. This one was a little blurry, some might consider it a Happy For Now. Sadly, this story fell far short of what I expected from Ms. Devine. Some may enjoy it, I recommend giving this one a pass.

I wanted this as a hamper for me to just keep in the laundry room just for my work clothes. It will definably do the job, but I don't think I would ever use it in a situation I need something heavy duty. The hamper itself is made of a lined canvas material. It doesn't have anything on the sides to help hold its form, so it looks wrinkled and floppy. If any piece of carelessly thrown clothes land in the top, the whole thing collapses. When it's more full it stands a little better, but empty it is lopsided unless I take the time to straighten it out each time I move it. The thing I love about it is that I work 4 days in a row, then have 10 days off. I come home, disrobe in the laundry room every night, then my first day off I wash all my laundry separate on \"sanitize\". After doing that I can fold this down, store it between the washing machine and the wall in that little couple inch space and then be done for the next 10 days off. I didn't want something just for my scrubs that takes up a bunch of space. It's a trade off, storability in exchange for heavy duty. Overall, I did a price comparison for other stuff out there.

Drensek</td><td>I found this book to be totally intriguing.  I don't agree with all of his points, his opinion of homosexuality is counter to scripture, but he is entitled, and he brings up some good points.  The key issue is homosexuality learned (nurture) or innate (nature).  If it is nature, why would a merciful God create a creature that is inherently going to be tempted to sin in that way.  In the book he covers a whole host of topics, and he is looking for the ethics in the situation, and brings in arguments that are not bible based.  If the ethics are to apply to everyone, it has to work within a biblical context and without.  In each area, he will look at different approaches to the key questions.  Very though provoking. If you are schooled in Christian legalism and tradition, this book will be unsettling.  It will challenge much of what you know.  Much of what is taught is not strictly biblical.  In many cases, it is legalism or tradition so as to avoid any hint of temptation to sin.  The question then arises is it reasonable to expect people to live like that, and is it really God's intention.  If we are truly allowed to reason, and have freedom and free will, there is a spectrum of behavior that is still biblical but not in accordance with tradition, and with the freedom comes responsibility.  Are we truly adult enough to handle what God has given us.  As with many things, teaching and tradition intervene since many can not handle their freedom. As for sex, he is very biblical in that sex is intended for marriage. He then goes into why.  There are physical, emotional, and spiritual questions and implications that surround sex.  Marriage was designed not to contain sex, but to provide the ideal safe environment to allow it to blossom into all the Lord intended.  It is play, pleasure, intimacy, physical, emotional, spiritual all wrapped up into one act, but not necessarily every iteration of the act.  From the Song of Songs we learn that it is also a pale imitation of the intimacy that is shared in Heaven, or in other words a foreshadowing of was it to be in Heaven, or a little piece of heaven on Earth. His questions are thought provoking, his answers are more so.  Some are just explorations into other lines of thinking, and he usually ends within a biblical context.  His position is not always within the mainstream church position. Sometimes, I think the church is not wrong but really not right, and sometimes the author is, but you should read it with an open mind, and decide for yourself. I thought his position on how men and women should interact (doesn't buy into some of the latest evangelical teaching that married men in particular and men should avoid women and avert their eyes to avoid lusting), and the interaction of the different modes of love (agape, eros, philos, and storch), in particular Eros and Agape in the context of marriage. Too bad for A. Stone, she obviously has learned the legalism and has many issues, but is not in tune with God.  Even worse for her husband.

Advanced Presentations by Design is one of the first that smartly addresses PowerPoint for the boardroom. First, the book talks about slide design, not with rule-of-thumb advice, but from a research-based perspective. Second, the book is not just a collection of ideas, but a 10-step method starting from analyzing your audience through to choosing a layout that passes the squint test. The SCoRE method, which involves moving through a presentation by introducing and resolving conflicts, also appears interesting. The method is clever, and based on insights found in Henry Boettinger's marvelous Moving Mountains. But I feel this approach is most appropriate for external audiences and for sales presentations. Still, it's one framework of many you might consider. There are some areas I would have liked to have seen covered more. For instance, should I use color on my slide? How much? Which colors? How do I make my slides look more attractive? How do I make better looking charts? There are several practical questions any business person would have that are not addressed in the book. Overall, Advanced Presentations by Design is part of a new wave of thinking about PowerPoint slide design based on research, not folk wisdom.

That was a time when you can get a variety of VHS movies from those Mom n' Pop video stores that were prevelant on basically every street corner with those movie treasures like Popcorn, Waxwork, Tales from the Darkside-The Movie, and a favorite of mine called Twilight Zone-The Movie. Those movie anthologies back then had a certain panache that had a mix of fright, gore, and even a hint of humor at times. Those kind of movies that you would pop in the VCR, microwave some popcorn, and enjoy. Lindsey Goddard's writing is just like that. The stories in this collection are fast-paced, creepy, and a narrative that flows like good tales often should. My favorites are The Woman in the Niqab (a tale worthy of Algernon Blackwood), Blood on the Highway (as gory as it is tragic), Damaged Goods (a revenge tale that is heart-wrenching as it is violent), and The Blue Girl. Good writing is no easy feat. You can tell Lindsey Goddard has a passion for good horror and a love for writing, in general.

Cardno</td><td>Is there anyone who reads genre fiction who isn't in some way interested in, if not obsessed with, Jack the Ripper? Jack, or versions of him, has appeared in mystery fiction, science fiction, fantasy and of course horror ... and I wouldn't be surprised to learn he's appeared in western stories too. Lockhart's volume contains only five reprinted stories; the remainder are new additions to the lore of Bloody Jack. Some are about Jack himself, some about his legacy. Some are stronger than others. But I suspect any Ripperologist (to steal the title of Orrin Grey's story) will find multiple reasons to enjoy this anthology. The book begins and ends with poems by Ann K. Schwader. The volume's prose starts with one of many stories that reveals Jack as a real, flawed, human (\"A Host of Shadows\" by Alan M. Clark and Gary A. Braunbeck), followed by one of the many that paints Jack as a malevolent spirit infecting individuals (\"Jack's Little Friend\" by Ramsey Campbell). These two stories set the tone of the book: dark and with a bit of a split personality, just like the legend that inspired it.  The reason most of these tales are so effective is that any one of them could be true. Again, as Orrin Grey has a character say in his tale, \"No theory, no proof, will ever quench men's thirst for the Ripper legend, because the Ripper can never be contained by any one suspect, or conspiracy, or narrative.\" Since I post individual story reviews on my livejournal short story community (http://365shortstories.livejournal.com/), I won't go into details here, but I will list the stories that most stuck with me weeks after reading them. Clearly, Orrin Grey's \"Ripperology,\" as I've referenced it so many times, is a favorite. I also have to call out the original stories Silvia Moreno-Garcia's \"Abandon All Flesh,\" Ennis Drake's \"The Butcher, The Baker, the Candlestick-Maker,\" E. Catherine Tobler's \"Once November,\" Laird Barron's \"Termination Dust\" and Ed Kurtz's \"Hell Broke Loose\" as particularly effective each in its own way, as well as the reprints of Joe R. Lansdale's \"The God of the Razor.\"  And I know my fellow fans of Philip Jose Farmer's Wold Newton concept will particularly enjoy Pete Rawlik's \"Villains, be Necessity,\" which plays the crossover game so very well but feels like only half of a story.</td><td>Rippers Past and Present</td><td>1.4043456E9</td><td>2014-07-03</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>2014-06-30</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>394</td><td>2317</td><td>0.10487226737226736</td></tr><tr><td>67047838</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1SRJ1PXH7ZB8E</td><td>1606410059</td><td>Elizabeth Houghton</td><td>No plot, it is nonfiction. great information for the seeker</td><td>great book</td><td>1.4961024E9</td><td>2017-05-30</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>2016-11-28</td><td>183</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>59</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>67047982</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A3KKMGTQDTWI28</td><td>194009965X</td><td>djforjesus</td><td>I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

Caroline is back in Houston and Colin is driving in for the weekend.  They spend a great weekend in New Orleans where she is reintroduced to his celebrity lifestyle of being recognized in public.  She also realizes that Colin still has communication problems regarding keeping things from others.  They have a lot to adapt to being a part of each others lives and a lot of history to catch each other up on.  Colin's ex girlfriend Sasha's interview regarding his cheating on her is published early and this causes all sorts of problems for Carolines medical practice.  She has decisions she has to make that are being forced on her by her father, her business partner.  The clientele being mostly football player injuries and she dating Colin gives the impression that she could pass on injury reports to other teams.

The unedited reel shows Hitler bowing & Mannerheim politely returning a short bow.).  The Marshal was also honored with a U.S. postage stamp in the Champions of Liberty series.

Who cares what you had for supper?) Connecting with old flames is something that I have done, had a chat & a phone call or two & moved on.  I found nothing in common with these guys now that I am married with a family and grandchildren.  It was hard for me to relate to women that used old connections to gain mostly sex with someone new and what seemed like an adventure. The book was an easy read, the characters well developed and the presentation from the various women's points of view was easy to follow and added interest to the story.  If you are a fan of social networks, and like a hot sexy story, this is the book for you. The author supplied me with a copy of this book and asked for an honest review and that is what I have written here.</td><td>Sex & the Social Network</td><td>1.389744E9</td><td>2014-01-15</td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>2014-01-07</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>223</td><td>1137</td><td>0.08433441558441558</td></tr><tr><td>67049812</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3T09YWRKKVTVA</td><td>B00FPT3MZQ</td><td>James Ward Kirk</td><td>I became a fan of William Cook through his novel, \"Blood Related.\"  This collection of short fiction and poetry proves he belongs in the upper echelon of horror writers.</td><td>William Cook is at the Top of His Game.</td><td>1.3912992E9</td><td>2014-02-02</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2013-01-09</td><td>389</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>169</td><td>0.075</td></tr><tr><td>67050105</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AYQ8I31JMBDHV</td><td>1493799320</td><td>Anna Stein</td><td>Very interesting, well written, well rounded characters.

Wanoo the Sorcerer: Naloo's Version shows children that to learn new skills takes practice and more practice and introduces the word perseverance. The concept is presented in a manner that children can understand and I used it with a group of children to draw them out and talk about when they had used perseverance to learn a new skill and extend the lesson and make it personal for the children I was working with. The children were mostly all just turned five-year-olds with a few still four-years-old; this age group understood the lesson easily toward the end of our school year. It would have been difficult at the beginning of the year for them first because the book has more writing than pictures and the concepts would not be developmentally appropriate for children a bit younger. After over forty-three years working as a preschool educator, I have enough experience to understand the ages and stages of development of preschool children and would suggest that the author change the description for five-year olds and up. I realize that some younger children would understand the concepts but the majority would not be ready for them.

Taschen has been very successful with their line of artist monographs; by using high quality paper stock and a generous 9.75 x 12.25 inch format, plenty of large-sized, high-resolution images, and biographical, historical and critical overviews provided by well-respected sources, they could easily justify a higher price-tag. Instead, they use common-sense to offer high-quality books for far lower prices. By keeping all of the artists in this line of '25th Anniversary' deluxe hardcover editions (still being produced today as the '25th Year' despite the fact its now closer to 35, oh well, details) in a basically uniform package design, it has cut down on printing costs and allowed the publisher to charge $20.00 for a book that would cost twice as much were it published elsewhere. In the case of 'Dix', in particular, you really are getting an amazing deal. I purchased the 'Otto Dix' hardcover from Prestel (released in conjunction with a retrospective exhibition in Montreal and New York) a month or two before I ordered the Taschen book. The Prestel version is absolutely beautiful itself, and the various scholarly contributions are illuminating; It is clothbound, with a striking cover featuring Dix' portrait of Anita Berber, and I would probably rate it highly if I reviewed it; but it leaves out some of Dix' most important paintings, or reproduces them as little more than thumbnails, masterpieces like 'The Seven Deadly Sins' and 'Flanders'. While the Prestel volume is a bit longer at 270 pages, the 225 page Taschen monograph feels like the more comprehensive of the two, reproducing the aforementioned works both in full and in detail, and is slightly larger at 9.75 x 12.25 inches compared to the 9.5 x 11.5 inch dimensions of the other. While I was glad to find two excellent books about such a difficult and comparatively obscure artist, If I had to recommend one it would definitely be the Taschen book... right now, it is selling at $11.51(!that's cheaper than a lousy mmpb!), while Prestels' great book on Otto Dix is going for $46.00 (down considerably from its regular price of $72.00). For less than 12 lousy bucks you can own a book that could easily sell for 4 times that amount.

Charlotte is an independent business woman with a dream of being a writer, and while she has strong ties to her family and its bookstore, she finds herself escaping her life for a new beginning in England. The story was difficult to follow at first, as I got very confused with the interplay of nicknames for Charlotte being used at the beginning. However, once adjusted I was able to escape into the novel and really enjoy the drama of her first relationship ending and Charlotte's inner debate over starting a new relationship so soon after arriving in England.  This story had all the basics of a sexy romance novel; relateable heroine, annoying ex, new heart throb boyfriend, tastefully constructed sex scenes, misunderstanding causing heart break,  resolution and happy ending. I greatly enjoyed it for a weekend read. The interesting cover made for a great reveal upon finishing the book, and now I truly love it and makes me smile. I was surprised again by Beth Massey's writing style and not because I at all disliked it, but once again I noted how very different it was from her previous novels.  \"Goodly Creatures\" is one of my favorite P&P retellings. It is a dark and twisted retelling that openly addressed an often concealed and hidden topic of the 19th century.  With \"Mr. Darcy Likes it Wild\", while expecting something similar I was instead surprised at the stark difference to her previous tale. Now with Thoroughly Modern Charlotte I was startled by the uniqueness of her writing and ability to create a completely different tone and conquer a new genre. This appears to be a series and I look forward to reading the rest for sure, but I now know better than to have any expectations as to its content except that I will enjoy it.</td><td>Enjoyable Modern Romance with a Jane Austen Twist</td><td>1.4279328E9</td><td>2015-04-02</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>2011-05-30</td><td>1403</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>324</td><td>1856</td><td>0.14489669421487597</td></tr><tr><td>67054422</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A1R4VBIQ56WF8L</td><td>B01DXAFZHG</td><td>Freedgrl33</td><td>This product is very good,it serves a number purposes not just to keep the draft out but creeping and crawling insects that might get in through a door that has a gap although much longer than the door itself it is easily folded under to meet the appropriate measurements which is what I did it functions in the sense that it opens and closes with the door quiet easily I would suggest using a sucker fabric just in case it might come into contact with a sharp implement  that might tear the fabric I believe it is worth every penny.</td><td>Great invention good price.</td><td>1.472688E9</td><td>2016-09-01</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2016-01-15</td><td>230</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>101</td><td>533</td><td>0.18240740740740743</td></tr><tr><td>67054707</td><td>1</td><td>true</td><td>ARYURXDOUBYD6</td><td>B00GGZSW30</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>The writing is poor, the grammar worse - so much so many recipes simply cannot be followed.

Already a big fan of the author and the series, reading this next installment could have gone one of two ways: Disappointment or Excitement/Happieness.  This is a great bookso Excitement/Happiness wins. Devany Miller is a divorced, mother of two that works at a shelter that helps abuse/struggling women and children.  Oh, and shes also part witch, part wyndling, part skriven and a few other fun things mixed in for good measure.  And did I mention she kicks ass and takes names? Although you don't truly need to read this series from the beginning book, The Bazaar, to enjoy the book, it may help in the long run when it comes to understanding Devanys relationship with the assorted characters and character types that appear in the pages.  The author does a sufficient job bringing new readers up to speed, but the book is very fast paced, so someone new really needs to buckle in. The common theme that runs through this book, as well as the series, is that Devany is trying desparately to save/protect her familybut life has a way of throwing a curveball in your path at times.  Devany makes decisions that have broad ranging effects on everyone and everything around herlike a ripple in a pond.  Some of those decisions are mistakes, some BIG mistakes, but she owns them and does what she can to fix the mistakes, all while trying to save her family and loved ones and figure out who she is. Jen Ponce is a very talented author that has a great knack for writing amazingly strong female leads.  This book is full of great characters, a brilliantly thoughtout storyline with lots and lots of layers and enough action to keep fans of Fantasy/Urban Fantasy fully satisfied.

McLaughlin</td><td>For those primarily looking for a romance novel you'll want to look elsewhere. While there is a lesbian romantic element to The Sistine Heresy it is not central to the story and develops very slowly. Rather, this book brings to life Rome in the Renaissance period and inserts gay characters into various roles. As it states in the About the Author section, this book is part of an effort by Saracen to \"plant our flag retroactively on the literary and historical landscape.\" For those who really enjoy historical novels and find it difficult to find any with lesbian/gay characters then this one will be a real treat. Most of the characters are actual historical figures, though the main character and a few others are fictional. Of course many of the details of events in the book are also fictionalized, but it's done in such a way that the made-up blends seamlessly with actual history. Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel take center stage, but there is so much more; the Church and popes, the Spanish Inquisition, Italian states, politics, gender roles, hints of the Reformation to come, the influence of the old pagan and the clash of modern science starting to emerge, and so on. All this is seen through the eyes of a fictional character who is part of the Borgia family by marriage and who is caught up in all the events swirling around her and trying to survive on her own terms as much as possible. There were a few places in the book where the pacing dragged a bit or the historical stuff was almost too dense, making it a bit dry. So readers who are a bit more impatient may not enjoy it as much, but for me it wasn't an issue and I read the book through very quickly. I think one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much is that not only was it a well-written novel about the period, but it encouraged me to spend time online after I was done reading it looking up information about the Borgias, Michelangelo, the Sistine Chapel, etc. Walk-ons by people such as Martin Luther and Leonardo da Vinci only added to the historical fun. For those wanting a fluff romance read don't bother as you'll be disappointed. Staunch Catholics will be offended. But for the lesbian history buff The Sistine Heresy is probably right up your alley.

The author takes a harsh and often graphic view of the life of Evan Jameson; from his first memory at eighteen months old through middle age. Starry-Eyes is an angelic figure that Evan sees at various moments in his life. Since she shows up during moments Evan is usually facing a crossroads, I wondered if Starry-Eyes was a manifestation of Evan's conscience. When he has made what one could perceive as the `wrong' choice, she appears saddened by his actions. Unfortunately for Evan Jameson, his life is shaped by cruel people. CRUEL explores how bullying affects a young life. Eventually, Evan becomes capable of bullying himself. He was a difficult character to connect with, until a moment in the book when the opportunity arose for Evan to put a bully in his place. When he pounded a nail through his tormentor's hand, I found myself finally connecting with Evan, and even cheering him on. Unfortunately, Starry-Eyes was there to ruin the moment. Was I becoming cruel? Remember, this is fiction! Take Evan's journey, if you dare. There are graphic depictions of sex, cruelty to animals, even moments that border on torture. If there is ever a ban on books, I'm sure Eli Wilde's skillfully written novel, CRUEL, will be near the top of the list. So you might want to read it while you still can... CRUEL By: Eli Wilde A review by Bruce Lockhart 2nd Cruel, by Eli Wilde, is a rollercoaster ride that plunges the reader into a hellish void. It pulls back the veil that covers the world's darkest secrets, revealing things most choose to ignore. We view the life of Evan Jameson through fractured eyes, as he's constantly tormented by bullies. It allows us to better understand the mind of someone whose been pushed to edge one too many times. Evan is a complex character, and, for some, it may be difficult to relate or even sympathize with him. But I think everyone, at some point in their life, has been knocked down by the cruelty of this world. This book is graphic; it entails sex and animal cruelty, along with a scene where a boy gets crow's wings nailed to his back. It might be hard to swallow, and the book may not even satisfy your thirst for a victorious protagonist. Nonetheless, Cruel will make the reader truly look at the ugliness of the world; it pulls back the blinds as Eli Wilde masterfully shines a light on the everlasting evils surrounding us every day. Cruel forces the reader to accept the world for what it really is, good and bad all mixed together. I hope people who dare to read this book will do so with the knowledge that the world is broken, and vile things do happen. Only when we can accept that can we hope to change it. Maybe we all need to learn to be a little less cruel... These reviews are offered from mother and son writing partners.

Katrina is about sixteen now and is going to Stonehenge for her Winter Abroad, something all young witches must experience on their own.  Her younger brother Rune, a half-vampire, is being sent to visit his father in Transylvania, but since he isn't keen on that idea, he takes off (via the Troller-Coaster again  see v. 1) and follows his sister.  Through the trickery of a fellow student witch, Kat and Rune both end up passing through a magic portal into the world of Gaelic Faery.  Here we meet magical creatures  the stag Sianach, the green Hound from Hell Cusith, the fairy cat Cait Sidhe, a unicorn named Diamond, and others.  But the most sinister and the most darkly funny character is the winter goddess Cailleach, who through lack of worshippers, has deteriorated into her hag form.  Cailleach is eager to seize this young witch who is trespassing in her realm so she can steal her magic and regain her youthful powers. Marva Dasefs stories are particularly fun for their allusions and send-ups of our modern day.  For example, when Kat makes a map of her trip appear in the air, Rune remarks, Looks like Google Earth, except see-through.  Cailleach has a book on her shelf called Selling Love Potions on the Internet.  The Otherworld is infested with skrats, strange little feathered creatures that appear to be a cross between a chicken and a rat.  Actually, a skrat is an entity from Scandinavian folklore, but I was immediately reminded of Scrat from the Ice Age movies.  The fairy cat Cait Sidhe is a particularly entertaining character, always independent according to cat nature but more willing to help than he wants to admit.  He spouts breezy jargon, throwing out Spanish phrases like De nada, calling the unicorn the donkey, and addressing Kat as witchy. The story gets more serious toward the end, however, when Rune undergoes a coming-of-age ordeal of his own in confronting Cailleach.  After this experience he will never be quite the same devil-may-care youth that he has been in the series up to now. And one more remark.  The author threw in frequent references to the Wizard of Oz, particularly toward the end of the book.  They add to the books richness and are a lot of fun. I have given all three books in this series four stars.  This one is definitely the best and if I could, I would give it four and a half.  I recommend the series for any young person in the appropriate age group, and its a fun read for adults as well!</td><td>Young Witches Come of Age</td><td>1.3904352E9</td><td>2014-01-23</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2013-12-01</td><td>53</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>494</td><td>2730</td><td>0.19637568870523417</td></tr><tr><td>67059526</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A3W4W7BUCUINQS</td><td>1481999958</td><td>ALLEN STRICKLAND</td><td>Good case studies but not as good as his first book \"Deals on Wheels\".</td><td>Good examples and case studies.</td><td>1.4301792E9</td><td>2015-04-28</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>70</td><td>0.5499999999999999</td></tr><tr><td>67059723</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A2GQ42VTDDO409</td><td>1514784998</td><td>George Shadow</td><td>Summary: In 1972 a disgraced college professor and a retired FBI agent set out to discover, once and for all, the final resting place of the legendary Treasure of the Knights Templar. Days later, both men disappear without a trace. Forty years later, spurred on by the discovery of a long lost manuscript, the Professors son hires historians Paul Davenport and Sara Walsh to pick up where his father left off. Their adventure leads them from Benjamin Franklins Freemasons to the early days of the Civil War, from World War II Paris to the corrupt world of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI. But Davenport and Walsh aren't alone in their search. A fanatical group of Neo-Knights have infiltrated the Freemasons in an attempt to reignite the Crusades. And watching them all from the shadows is a mysterious figure known as The Bookkeeper. From the Capitols of old world Europe to a remote estate on the coast of Canada, to a small town in Pennsylvania, Davenport and Walsh discover kidnapping and murder, and go from hunters to prey as they get closer and closer to the secrets of The Templar Succession. Historical Context: Freemasons and the knights' templars have always been fascinating topics for fiction novels. Usually the contention is where all that treasure was finally hidden, but THE TEMPLAR SUCCESSION brings into the picture a very tight plotline laced with intrigues. A plan hatched in the minds of a certain group of men is poised to take the world by storm if not uncovered and routed, and what better duo is there to do this than our heroes? Book Cover and Interior Formatting: The cover image is good, but the red used for the title fonts as well as the font itself don't just add up. I'm of the opinion that a brighter color would have better enhanced the fonts, which should have been bolder, thicker or more solid. The interior design is okay. No problems there. Writing Style: It's never easy to bring a book to life right from the planning stage to the actual writing and completion of the book.  At this I must commend Author Eckert for doggedly pursuing his ambition to completion, even though some typos make the work a bit difficult to read. Also this reviewer feels that the chapters should be condensed two or three at once into one full chapter. I think this will enhance the reading pleasure of the book, but a great story here. I also liked the way Author Eckert builds suspense in the story. It's like watching a movie and I must contend him for this. My Thoughts: Highly recommended for your reading pleasure.

I couldn't put it down.  In the first chapter, after the introduction, \"What is Marriage?\" was worth the cost of the book alone.  No one really asks him or herself this question.  This is what Glenn Campbell has to say, which I think is pure genius: \"Under the law, marriage is quite simple: It is an economic contract to share future income and liabilities.  You can layer on top of it whatever emotional meaning you want, but what the law sees is primarily a merging of your economic activity.\" What we don't think about beyond the intoxicating euphoria of romance and falling in love is that marriage is a serious compromise of economic and personal freedom, and there is no way we can know for sure after we say, \"I do\" that we will want this for the \"rest of our life\" with this person.  There is no way to know ahead of time.  It is a crap shoot whether you want to accept this reality or not.  And if we later discover after marriage that this compromise of economic and personal freedom is not worth it, it can become now way too costly to leave through divorce, so it becomes like the old blues song, \"It's Cheaper to Keeper.\" You CAN marry blindly out of pure love and romance and the beauty of the wedding ceremony, but most of the things you THINK you're going to get from a marriage: love, sex, companionship CAN be obtained WITHOUT marrying.  (If children are not your main objective for marrying, then you need to ask yourself, what are you really bargaining for?)  Your money upon marrying, will no longer be your own, nor will your personal freedom. This book will make you THINK beyond the temporary insanity of love and romance, which comes and goes.  Marrying without giving your motives real thought, can be too late before being able to get out of an economic and personal prison without costing you everything you have worked for in life.  Buy this book BEFORE you marry the first time, and surely before you marry again, and THEN make your decision.  It is the best premarital counseling you can buy for $15. If marry you must, this book unwittingly makes a strong case for a prenuptial contract, no matter how much \"in love\" you think you are! Traditional marriage without a prenup is tantamount to doing somersaults without a net, skydiving without a parachute, or working S.W.A.T. without a bullet-proof vest.

The author's clear descriptions of the patients, their pains and the surgical procedures, not to mention the saw and other primitive tools used to probe inside gaping incisions, are both mesmerizing and ghastly alive. The writing is so convincing that you begin to feel as if you are there, suffering as a patient or stoicly ignoring the patients screams to continue the procedure as a surgeon should. The point is clearly made that many early day surgeons were butchers, both literally and figuratively. I admit, I haven't finished this book yet.  I really want to take my time savoring the atmosphere of this historical novel. I felt a need to write something about the pleasure and pain spent reading the first pages.  The stories within the story just keep coming and so far not one has dulled my interest. The writing stands true and concise.  The characters are easily imagineable, so easy that its as if you recognize some from childhood visits to a doctor's office. Just try putting yourself in a doctor or patient's shoes of that era, that is where the reading becomes timeless and engaging. But the real horror in reading this book about surgery prior to anesthesia is that it wasn't during the times of ancient Greece or Rome; this is a story that takes place in mid-nineteenth century Western civilization.

This book is a continuation but instead of it focusing on Tony and Kristine it involve Andi, Kristines friend from the district attorney's office and Gray. Years ago Andi and Gray shared a weekend in which she became pregnant for eight years she believed Gray was dead and raised their son on his own. Gray was called to a DEA job and was not heard from in 8 years. He was kidnapped and tortured. When Andi finds out he is back she has many decisions to make on whether to tell him about his son and where life will go from her. I loved both books. It reads very quickly.

The thing is, there was such a huge build up in the first one, could there ever be a satisfactory pay off in the second? Wellll, if you like Lovecraft, Barker, or Masterton... then yes. The shadows of the first book, become outright darkness in the second and we see how the villainous Raven Men have manipulated our world history for eon. For me, I particularly enjoyed the more frequent visitations to Sumerland, and the fleshing out that mythology. The plot continues exactly where \"A Gathering...\" left off. Celus is not the hero we think he is, but actually a machiavellian traitor with his own agenda. Greine is an entrenched bitter old man, and George Tate is just a pawn being pushed about. There are revelations about his wife, Irene, and the children, and ripple effects from actions in the first book begin to have dire consequences, culminating in mind numbing genocide, chaos, and ultimately madness. My only exception to this book is the ending. If you want a \"good\" ending, then you will be disappointed. If you want some dark, gritty, and perhaps a bit more realistic then you will love it.

It might even be helpful to talk about the different names Santa Claus is called. Because this author has changed the city in her story to Americanize it, but has left a phrase no first grade student will know. SO WHAT! It's never too soon to teach our children that people from other countries speak languages other than English, they might wear clothes you can't find at T.J. Maxx, and it's possible they use different words or phrases to describe  things, even when they are speaking English. I'm referring to the phrase 'milk tooth' . We use the phrase 'baby tooth' to identify one of the first set of non- permanent teeth human beings have, the teeth we pull to make room for our permanent, adult teeth. The only time we say milk tooth is in reference to animals. Dogs and cats have milk teeth. So do horses. I'm no veterinarian, but it's a safe bet that all dumb (meaning without speech) mammals have milk teeth. It was a little strange that an author from outside the U.S.A. had the forethought to use an address in Florida for the main character, yet failed to use an American name for a child's first teeth. However, this provides the parent with a chance to teach. I really, really wish we had been shown the present the tooth fairy left. Since the tooth fairy on this side of the Atlantic leaves money, I spent most of the book wondering what kind of present would be left. I kept hoping it wasn't a pair of socks.

It tells the story of the young angel Koji from his creation until his first encounter with Prissie Pomeroy, the event that begins the first book of the main Threshold series. I think I find Koji an even more engaging character in 'Angel on High' than I do in the main series, and that's already saying a lot. He has an exceptional capacity for observation and understanding even when just newfound. I defy anyone to meet him and not to love him. :) My other big reason for liking 'Angel on High' is that it provides a brief view of someone who appears in several other places in rather a different guise. But that brief view has served to make me so fond of the 'someone' that whenever I met them again later, I always want to burst into tears and cry, \"Noooooooo! You were so beautiful!\" Beware the power of a writer... Who should read this story? Anybody who can. Possibly, the said Anybody might want to read 'The Blue Door' beforehand, in order to understand where Koji went after this story ends.

Sozaeva</td><td>Book Info: Genre: Urban Fantasy/Mystery/Thriller Reading Level: Adult Recommended for: Fans of thrillers/suspense w/ a paranormal twist, and a touch of romance. Trigger Warnings: Murder, violence My Thoughts: I was initially hesitant about accepting this book, as it is rated as paranormal romance and I'm just not a huge fan, but the author assured me the romance is secondary to the plot of the story, so I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did, as I enjoyed the story immensely, and I particularly liked the ideas it gave about fate and taking control of our own future. I saw one reviewer who complained that the book was mostly the main character \"moping.\" I had to say... How would you react if you could predict often horrible upcoming events, but not do a bit to change things? If you knew people were going to die, or accidents were going to happen, but you couldn't stop them? You wouldn't exactly be a shiny, happy bluebird on someone's shoulder, would you? Amsden does a really good job with characters. She creates characters that are unique and memorable without being clich&eacute;. I'd love to discuss some of the things I read, but that would be spoiler-y, so I'll just say--if you like thrillers with a paranormal twist and just a dash of romance, then you will love this book. I recommend it. Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. Synopsis: Marianne can predict the future but is powerless to alter its course. After a lifetime spent coming to terms with an ability that has cost her much, including her marriage, Marianne moves halfway across the country to make a fresh start and salvage her relationship with her daughter, who has inherited her terrible ability. Once there, Marianne is drawn to a group of women who share her ability. She starts to find meaning and purpose--until she finds one of them murdered. In the wake of the murder, Marianne is once again caught up in predictions she is powerless to change. Complicating matters, she finds herself falling in love with the handsome Detective Derek Richards--a man who, her daughter predicts, will become an intimate part of her future. Time is running out for Marianne. She must learn the truth--about herself, about her power, and about the murderer--before she becomes the next victim.</td><td>Wonderful story, highly recommended!</td><td>1.3601952E9</td><td>2013-02-07</td><td>61</td><td>5</td><td>2013-01-27</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>404</td><td>2351</td><td>0.1490990990990991</td></tr><tr><td>67067021</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A2F6909CQ1ALLW</td><td>988943158</td><td>Julie Failla Earhart</td><td>I debated long and hard as to whether or not I should give McCall's last novel four or five stars...for five stars...I was hooked with the plot and the character.

An emaciated runaway, Abigail Sloan is living on the streets of New Orleans in 1858.  Life in a New Orleans brothel isn't easy for girl. Although she isn't considered one of the \"girls,\" that doesn't stop a drunk to having his way with her. Abigail is rescued after stealing a roll from a bakery. Luckily, her captor isn't the police, but David Cranshaw, who has a heart has big as his pocketbook.  He takes her home to his servants and his wife, Mariah to stabilize her. This reader was never crystal clear on why David saved Abigail. Could be he needed a project other than Mariah. Mariah was in despair over the death of their baby girl, Rosemary, and sinking lower every day. Then, Abigail turned up with child as a result of the rape she encountered at the brothel. Abigail wasn't sure what to do, but David saw his chance. If Abigail would give her baby, the one she claimed she did not want, to David and Mariah, well, slipping a new baby in Mariah's arms would fix everything. The results leave to a wonderful read, even if the slave dialect is intrusive.

In his \"alternative Gospel\", he provides a riveting narrative which puts the reader into the point of view of an intellectually disabled young man named Jotham who encounters and follows Jesus in His earthly ministry.  Life has been cruel to Jotham, his mother died, and his father and sister do not have the ability to love him as she did. He is depressed and confused until he finds Jesus, calls him Abba, and leaves home to follow Him. Those with limited verbal ability experience the world as a series of sensations and emotions, and react rather decidedly when they are either repulsed or attracted to a person. My daughter Christina, who has Down syndrome, makes up her mind instantly whether a person is trustworthy and I have found her judgment remarkable. These singular individuals see with their hearts, rather than their eyes and are less likely to be misled, as Judas was, by externals. Even St Peter is less in tune with Christ than Jotham, who from the first minute he encounters Christ, and sees the light in Him and follows him wholeheartedly. Only Our Lady emanates the same type of light which Jotham sees in her Son, and he immediately bonds with her, as he senses the love of his mother in her and calls her Mama. Jotham merely wants to bask in this light, which he sees more clearly than all the other disciples because of his pure soul: his fierce devotion to Christ is unencumbered by ambition or fear of ridicule. \"Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God.\" Matt. 5:8. At times this book brought me to tears as it unveiled the astonishing spiritual truth; that you do not need to employ your intellect to know Jesus, you only need to open your heart. Power's simple tale reveals his profound understanding of the unique spiritual gifts the disabled offer the world.  Jesus had people like Jotham and my daughter in mind when He said, \"Unless you become like little children you shall not enter the Kingdom of God.\" Matt. 18:3 The most moving part of \"The Book of Jotham\" is the account from Jotham's perspective of Christ's Passion and death. Powers is not content to leave Jotham as helpless observer as the other disciples were, but, because of his disability, he becomes an active participant in the salvific suffering of Christ. He suffers the same type of derision, abuse, and rejection Our Lord experiences and responds with the same forgiving love. Providence College Theology Professor Dr. Paul Gondreau, whose disabled son Dominic was embraced by Pope Francis before the eyes of the world on Easter Sunday explains it this way, \"Christ's resurrection from the Cross proclaims that the love he offers us, the love that we, in our turn, are to show others, is the REAL reason he endured the Cross in the first place. Our stony hearts are transformed into this Christ-like love, and thereby empowered to change hatred into love, only through the Cross. And no one shares in the Cross more intimately than the disabled. And so the disabled become our models and our inspiration.\" The Book of Jotham is exceptional Lenten reading, not only because it allows us to re-imagine the death and resurrection of Christ from the point of view of the disabled, but because that perspective is one which God, in His great love, has given us as a spiritual guide.

This is the first time I have ever tried a product specifically made for the side mirrors. Here's why I love them: PROS: Fit my 94 Ford Explorer and my 97 Saturn SW2. They fit both vehicles perfectly. A little snug on the Ford, but not really an issue. Rain, then freeze...ugh.  We had one of those hard rains that froze almost instantly. The mirrors were dry as a bone and frost free. The covers were frozen, but they didn't leak through. The ice that was stuck to the covers just fell off. Snow just falls off too. The quick cords make it so easy to attach. Slide the cover over the mirror and pull on the clamp stop. It tightens around the end and voila, done. It's like putting a jacket on your mirrors. this is made of a nylon/polyester windbreaker type material that is lined with an insulating material. Together they keep them frost and ice free. CONS: They didn't fit my Chevy van. Not really a con since I saw the size in the description and I knew right away they wouldn't fit. I guess they could make multiple sizes to accommodate larger mirrors. I received a set of these wing mirror snow covers in exchange for my review. I was not obligated to give a good review, these are just my honest opinions. If you are tired of trying to scrape your side mirrors, then give these a try. Just measure your mirrors first to make sure these will fit. I would recommend these to anyone who lives in snow and ice country.</td><td>Simple and effective protection from snow and ice</td><td>1.4591232E9</td><td>2016-03-28</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>2013-06-02</td><td>1030</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>281</td><td>1480</td><td>0.231218935385602</td></tr><tr><td>67069292</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1T0V5WF7W9GK7</td><td>1974600475</td><td>john phillips</td><td>Mr Southworth really knocks it out of the park with this great book.

Like one review said, this is an introductory text with intermediate problems.  I couldn't finish this book before writing a review, because, as I go wrap up chapter 9, I can't help but note the poor presentation of dead-weight loss and gains/loss in consumer and producer surplus as well as the effect of welfare. The fact is that they try to avoid calculus, and that's well and fine (graphical problems can pretty easily be explained with algebra as the presentations generally deal with linear sloping curves).  However, the problem is the amount of fluff in this material (most of the time the authors are redundant); that is, most of the 40-50 page chapters can be summarized in 20 or less and actually be much more explanatory of the problems at hand. Once you get to the MyEconLab assignments, my God watch out.  These things are nothing like the stuff presented in the chapters--sure there's a simple direct question from time to time, but the problems that require working through solutions generally use terminology that isn't even present in the chapter.  The exercises of chapter 9 have been the epitome of this.  As well, the given answers to solve the problems in MyEconLab aren't even using the same terminology of the chapters...it's as if these problems are a whole new section within the given chapter instead of expounding upon them.  Oh, as well, the Chapter 9 problems are so hair-trigger sensitive to answers that even if you are close by a few pennies, you'll miss the problem....what's worse is that the same problem will have an answer that clearly used rounded inputs and the final answers wouldn't.  It's absolutely ludicrous.

I loved how the book went through a whole process leading up to other men dressing up to represent Santa himself, even though children know there is only one Santa. This is not a picture book but one for children who can read well or a book for a bit older children to be read to. The story is well thought out and a book that certainly could easily become a family favorite read year after year. I loved the illustrations that went along with the book. They are muted in Christmas colors and have a semi-Norman Rockwell feel to them. The illustrations add to an already great book that gives the reader a cozy feel and also answers questions that all children have about Santa. Great book and 5 stars from me.

Throughout this series of essays, David Gontar addresses different aspects of the plays and poems, offering a unique interpretive approach. As he did in his first book, he reveals their many interconnections, unexplored topics, undiscovered character relationships, and recurring themes. His forte is exposing much of the superficial opinions that pass for contemporary Shakespearean criticism on todays college campuses. He repeatedly demonstrates that much of this shallow criticism is filtered through the lenses of ideology and political correctness, leading to blatant distortions of Shakespeares original intentions. Gontar will have none of this. He continually advises his readers to focus on what Shakespeare actually says, rather than relying upon someone elses interpretation of what he said. He asserts it is often necessary to unread the plays, as we cast aside our own shallow preconceived notions taught to us many years ago. Hence the title, \"Unreading Shakespeare.\" For fresh, in-depth analysis of the works of Shakespeare, theres none better than David Gontar. The book is well written, well edited, and well researched. David Gontars erudition, depth of knowledge of the subject matter, and genuine love for Shakespeare is breathtaking, a devotion obviously cultivated over many years. It is highly recommended for those who seek to expand their Shakespearean horizons and to those who have a love of great literature.</td><td>Geat new book of Shakespearean criticism!</td><td>1.4360544E9</td><td>2015-07-05</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2008-06-11</td><td>2580</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>255</td><td>1706</td><td>0.22362718089990818</td></tr><tr><td>67072269</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A84L9RIMSBTRP</td><td>B009277NBG</td><td>T.

Just like a cable network's \"original movie\", it had plenty of sexual encounters, most of which not making any sense. When you thought that something interesting was almost happening, the writer completely killed it in the next chapter. This book, if available in paperback, can be used for kindling.

As a native of the Bronx, raised by a Manhattan-born father as a Giants' fan and converted at an early age to the one true faith of the New York Yankees, I have a particular bias against the endless whining and whingeing emanating from Brooklyn ever since the Bums (so aptly named) packed up and left their decrepit, low-rent digs on Empire Blvd. (nee Malbone Street, site of the worst subway disaster in the city's history) for the elysian sunshine of Chavez Ravine. That being said, I was entirely engrossed and deeply impressed by Robert Murphy's After Many a Summer. This is a dense book, not in the sense of dull or impenetrable, but in the way that first-rate fiction is--richly nuanced, in constant confrontation with ambiguity and contradiction, putting aside simplistic good-against-evil scenarios in favor of the Rashomon nuances that shade and shape all truth. Murphy won't settle for stereotypes. The Robert Moses of this book isn't the Snidely J. Whiplash-type villain of Caro's The Powerbroker. Walter O'Malley is neither Brooklyn's answer to Adolf Hitler nor the Christopher Columbus of Major League Baseball's western expansion. Horace Stoneham is no longer merely an enigma or a nonentity. For the first time, I understood (if not approved) of his decision to rip the Giants untimely from their mother's womb. (And was reminded once again of that great line from Jean Renior's Rules of the Game: \"The truly terrible thing about this world is that everybody has his reasons.\") In truth, After Many a Summer is a book about baseball in the way that Moby Dick is a book about fishing. In pursuit of his Great White Whale--the how, why, what and who of New York's epic loss of two legendary sports franchises in a single season--Murphy instructs and enligthens us about the history of Brooklyn (his passionate affection for his native borough is obvious but never clouds his judgment ); the evolution/devolution of post-WWII urban American in general and New York City in particular; the intricacies of making public policy and mechanics of running MLB; and the eternal complications wrought  by human vices, virtues, subjectivity, idiosyncrasies and emotions. After Many a Summer is a model of erudition and graceful writing, a combination in increasingly short supply. Whether you love or loathe baseball, this is a book to be savored and enjoyed. I was engaged and entertained throughout.

If you write fiction, you can hide behind a character, but with poetry there is nowhere for the true poet to hide who they are or what they feel. This is the difference between being a poet and writing poetry and B.L.Ronan is a poet.  As an author, she has taken me on a journey that made me cry, squirm, shutter, stop breathing, and sigh, as her poems run the gamut from deeply heartbreaking to sexually alluring.  These are not poems for the faint of heart, these are raw, real, soul-ripping prose whose imagery sucked me in, made me feel and experience every emotion that Ronan wrote. I loved that she gave me, the reader, multiple perspectives of situations that I may never experience personally, but because of her writing, I now have.  Her poetry and prose ripped a hole in my heart, which she also filled with so much beautiful language and imagery. The poems run the gamut from despair and heartache to those of self-awakening and sexual sensuality.  The poems that deal with sexual situations invoke the emotions of not just those portrayed in the poems, but also from the reader.  I have been loved tenderly with reverence. I have been bound and willingly submitted because of these poems. I have also been a dominate,taking loving care of the submissive under my hands. Every emotion in a human's life poet Ronan has masterfully dealt with the good, the bad, the ugly,  and the blissful.  Ronan tells a story in a poem with as much detail and nuance as some authors do with an entire novel. If you want to be knocked on you behind by words, then read Saudade by  B.L. Ronan. The works like Whole, Fine, Mess, Hope, and Steps in the first part of the book shattered my heart and brought me to tears. Sobs racked my chest and it was hard to see my eReader to continue. I am not a crier, which needs to me noted, so when a book brings me to tears or rips into my soul, it is something profound. I was on a journey with this author-a journey of discovery through her words which invoked a mess of feelings inside of me. The book continues with powerful poems, heart wrenching poems until you come upon Until You.  Until You  is by far my favorite of all the poems; it sang to my soul. It is beyond brilliant in imparting the revelation of hope that is found within the words and the poet. With Until You the tone of the poems change from ones of a caterpillar who has had a very hard life, to those of a vibrant butterfly, spreading her wings and taking chances with her heart and her life. Not a perfect world, not a road traveled by all, but a journey begun in earnest to discover who one can become. The poem Inspired sums it up with the line \"the very essence of my broken but healing soul.\" Then there are the poems and prose of carnal delight, the exploration of sexual pleasure that made me squirm and have to stop reading in order to breathe.  There are many sensual delights in Saudade but Seduction: mind, body, heart and soul, stuck with me, as in enraptured me as the reader in the seduction.  I felt pulled into the piece so that I was experiencing the hot, pulsing desire of the words. But this is the case with all the poems in the book. B.L. Ronan, is a master story-teller, and she captured my heart and imagination with her words. I am a better person for having read this wonderful word.</td><td>Perfection</td><td>1.3756608E9</td><td>2013-08-05</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2013-06-18</td><td>48</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>638</td><td>3373</td><td>0.18117157665030004</td></tr><tr><td>67076017</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A2VU3TBZDCP8QA</td><td>B008ZHHE1I</td><td>KateM</td><td>There's something inherently creepy about puppets and Piggy is no exception to this.

This book is very much in that spirit.  You will not find complicated rituals here that must be obeyed to the letter, or hard and fast, very specific doctrines that must be memorized.  Instead the author gives you a broad description of general ideas and practices, and allows the reader to fill in the details according to what is right for them.  Also you are free to pick and choose between different ideas. As this is a beginner's book the emphasis is on the simple.  The author points out that even with these simple practices you don't have to keep everything exact, and that if you feel you want to add anything (get more complicated) you can certainly do that too. The book covers: Basic Beliefs (which as I have already indicated aren't had and fast) Meditation and Visualization (which is used quite a lot in spell casting)  These exercises are simple, but do require just a bit of practice. Basic Tools, such as a ritual knife (of which you can have as few or as many as you want) Simple Circle Casting (which uses some of the meditation and visualisation methods mentioned above) Sabbat Rituals and Spells (a general summary of the important celebration days throughout the year, plus simple rituals you can hold on these days) And, Correspondences For Ritual Design (the special meaning of and use of colours, herbs, stones, moon phases and days of the week) This section is really for those who want to get a bit more complicated in their practices, but once again the emphasis is on freedom rather than rigidity. I really liked the author's simple and free approach to this belief and practice.  The book's main purpose is to give the reader ideas to get them started.  If you want to get complicated you are of course free to do that (as the chapter on Correspondences points out), but the author does suggest that the simple can be just as effective. I have read quite a few introductions to Wicca and this book was definitely worth a five star rating for its non-rigidity and simplicity, while covering quite the breadth of the topic.</td><td>A simple and free, but effective approach to the topic</td><td>1.4900544E9</td><td>2017-03-21</td><td>56</td><td>1</td><td>2017-03-15</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>392</td><td>2173</td><td>0.11601461038961039</td></tr><tr><td>67076959</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>A2HT5KXRZQHUGI</td><td>786717629</td><td>Deborah L Stucky</td><td>I wanted to learn more about Garrett I felt it was too much about  Gordon.</td><td>Two Stars</td><td>1.4573952E9</td><td>2016-03-08</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>74</td><td>0.35</td></tr><tr><td>67076966</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>AW2SGASFXEWT3</td><td>B006XVD53O</td><td>Kindle Customer</td><td>I think this could have had more depth and personalizing of characters, but for a \"novella\" it was okay.

Never saw it coming. It reminds me of Catch 22 for some reason, but a helluva lot more entertaining. I read a lot of indie authors, but Rich Bottles Jr. writes so smoothly, with a sense of self awareness and smarmy jokes that connect like a boxer's left right, that I got the feeling I was reading a seasoned pro. A seasoned pro who knows how to have a good time with his tale. Even if the book itself is horrific in nature, and the characters lowlifes in general, there is intelligence. A very sharp intelligence, like the guy at a bar who can destroy another drunk with a well placed insight and a sentence and never have to throw a punch.  I get the feeling if Rich turned his sights on you he'd make you want to cry and laugh at the same time.

My four year old had a great time, while I read, he picked out the objects. He loved the way the bear with a \"missing ear\" that was shown with the \"flies\" around him. The story is about a little boy who has so many toys that his Dad wants him to share. My little guy did not like the idea of getting rid of any of his possessions, but he did like that the toys were going to kids in a Hospital. He was chuckling about how the boxed toys were put on top of the car, and he pointed out the ones that were falling out! Coot, the little boy, and ours is about the same age. What a great lesson for him to learn how to share, the rhyming prose and the pictures of the toys, along with the little boy, are priceless. He wants it read and read again!

Harris</td><td>I am a mother of two, and a Counselor. I have worked with children for over 15 years, in many settings-- schools, group homes, Child Services, daycares, etc. I find this program to be really healthy and grounded. Some things might not work for all children, but the basic ideas of building self-sufficient, thinking children are great. I think many people think \"love is enough\" when it comes to raising children, but I have not seen that to be true all the time. This program in about boundaries and training, it is true. To some this may seem harsh. I think it is loving. I also think too many parents don't have a clue what the difference between spoiling and loving, and between wishfullthinking and being proactive. This program is set up to dramatically cut down on yelling. It is set up around the idea of allowing for age-appropriate behavior, but also allowing children to experience natural consequences. Sometimes that is not going to make the child happy-- but it will let them learn, without you being the 'bad guy' all the time. It also pushes us to take a look at what we bring into the relationship, our own background and styles of relating. It pushes us to look at what we are teaching our children because of what be bring. It is not for parents who want to be the hero and the good guy all the time. It is not for wusses. But it is not that hard to learn what works for you, and the proof is in the pudding.</td><td>Very good, very grounded</td><td>1.1943072E9</td><td>2007-11-06</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2005-04-04</td><td>946</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>264</td><td>1427</td><td>0.3026388888888888</td></tr><tr><td>67084875</td><td>1</td><td>true</td><td>A2XDS9OZ9TD001</td><td>4770029454</td><td>Ray Macmeeken</td><td>I was very disappointed with this book.

I've already read this book several times since I find it one I like to go back to when I'm having trouble finding something new. Definitely hoping she continues this as a series. This story immediately immerses you into this new world set in a medieval backdrop with a culture of shifters. Don't let that fool you however as this isn't you're typical shifter romance as their ability to shift is really more of a supporting feature rather than a key attribute. Beautifully written, although a bit short I didn't feel the story suffered at all. Not one of those were the characters meet & 24 hours later they're completely in love & live HEA... you see the characters learning each other and growing.

The candles are easy to turn on and off with a simple small black button on the bottom of the candle. I did not have to do anything to the candle other than take it out of the box and turn it on and instant light. The candles made a nice ambiance in my bathroom on the tub. You can use just a couple of all of them, depending how much light you want. I also used them as a center piece for a candle lit dinner with my husband and we found the lighting to be very romantic using all 12 of the candles. I liked knowing that if I walked away and left them lit that I did not have the worries of a wax candle. Also they are a better choice when using around young children as you would not have the worries of them getting burnt when accidentally touched. The candles also looked really nice clustered together in a bowl. I liked how they helped set my mood for relaxation when I just wanted a bit of light. The candles can be used individually, in a set of 2, or in a set of any amount you like up to the whole set of twelve. Get romantic and set these out along the bathtub or bedside. If you want just a soft night time glow like I often like. I bought a pretty tray and set them out on the coffee table. When it is nighttime I switch the candles on. It is a such a soft glow and no harsh lights. The candles are very lightweight and they have the look of a candle with wax dripping down the side giving it a more authentic candle look. There is a little lamp in the middle of the candle to resemble a flame, and reminds me of a tiny Christmas light bulb when lit, but the lamp has a unique look to it with a slanted tip.

Turner's Point is stand-alone continues to Slipping on Stardust. I think a reader might get a better insights to the story at the beginning, if the previous book was read first. The cast of characters is plentiful, their lives and stories are bound together like a braid, their reflections in life are to the past, present, and to the future. Social issues such as gay-love, -marriage, and -adoption are touched, as well as reactions to the racially mixed couples. Despite the warning of the sexually explicit material, the love scenes are described in rather clean and tasteful way.

The storyline rambled on for far too long, the characters were not engaging at all. I felt no empathy when Tom lost his father, or when Olivia discovered hers. The kidnapping event was not very credible--at least not for me, and the paradoxical detectives--absolutely moronic. I most certainly hope that no hospital operates as poorly as this one seems to function. Additionally, I have no idea what the genre should be termed, beyond negligible. Perhaps, it was intended to make fun of the police in England. If that was the intent, it worked. If not, oh well. I'm not a fan of the author's writing style and I certainly wish someone would do some proofreading for him. I couldn't tell if some words were derivatives of the English version or just a slip of the fingers on a keyboard.

This is the story of Mercy Nelson, sister to Baron Geoffery Nelson and Aidan Kimbolt, Viscount of Lexford.  Mercy is introduced, though briefly, with her sister Grace in book 4 of the Real Series.  This spell binding saga continues to captivate me as few series have.  I recommend starting with book 1, A Touch of Scandal, in which we are introduced to the members of England's covert military regiment, the Realm, that operates in countries around far and near. The English gentry of the Realm become a \"band of brothers\", however each came to this assignment carrying emotional burdens based on family and associations of their past.  The service in the Realm has made them into a devastatingly powerful fighting machine.  Each book brings one of the Realm into focus and this book centers on the life of Aidan Kimbolt, Viscount Lexford.  Being a second son, Aidan enlisted in the military and during his tour of duty the love of his life, Susan Rhodes, was encouraged by her manipulative mother to marry his brother, Viscount Andrew, instead of waiting on Aidan.  Shortly after the marriage, Andrew is killed in a duel over his mistress and leaves a distraught Susan to bear his son Aaron (the heir) alone.  Aidan is released from his military duty to return home and assume the Viscount position at Lexington Arms.  His father forces Aidan to marry his brother's widow shortly before the Earl dies.  With all this drama, Lady Susan sets fire to the west wing of Lexington Arms and launches herself into the fire.  After her death, the Rhodes family quickly removes their grandson, Aaron, to their nearby estate to raise the boy.  Aidan is in emotional shambles when he was attacked at a fiends estate by a blow to the head.  This injury removes a large part of his memory. At about the time of Aidan's return to Lexington Arms from his injury, Mercy and Grace Nelson run away (separate events) from the dangerous and letcherous conditions at their home estate, Foresthill Hall, under the rule of their brother, Baron Geoffery Nelson.  Grace's story is in book 4.  Mr Hill, who pledged to serve Aidan for 10 years in payment for Aidan saving his life, finds Mercy Nelson (Mary Purefoy) sitting on a fence style on a dark road in a icy rainstorm.  Mary appears to be a lady of breeding and full of personal resolve, even if she was an innocent waiting for destruction.  She had been on her trek to London for six days..  She was cold, hungry and without hope.  Mr. Hill was impressed with her strength of character and convinces her to come to Lexington Arms with him as Aidan's cousin (to Aidan she was presented as a blow-by of the late Earl).  This only covers the first 3% of the book but sets up the drama and intrigue in this compelling adventure that eventually ends in a HEA.  The final reveal of all that transpired at Lexington Arms is astounding. Regina Jeffers is a master author to be able keep so many strong characters in play at the same time during this amazing series. I encourage all readers to give book one, A Touch of Scandal, a try.  I believe most of you will be hooked like I am and won't be able to stop until the final is book is finished.

This book is fun to read, and I don't see how anyone could read it without laughing at least once.  I lost count of how many times I cracked up while reading this book. Toby Grant gets a job as a service technician with Handy Dandy Services, but this job turns out to be way more than he bargained for. Ryan Burdell, one of the experienced technicians, is reluctant to train him but is still given the task to so.  Ryan does not treat Toby the best and is always calling him Newbie. Of course, this grates on Tobys nerves. And he constantly reminds Toby of the companys logo, service before self. The reason for their company logo is easy to see when you discover the places they go on their service calls. The service calls they go on are extremely entertaining.  The first house Toby and Ryan paid a service call to was my favorite. The first three sentences under Favorite Sentences come from this part of the book, so you can probably figure out how nasty the place was.  Toby is more than a little grossed out by it, but Ryan acts like it is just another day at work.  Im not sure which would have scared me more: the condition of that place or Ryan acting like it was normal. Each service call after the first one is entertaining in its own way. Toby even begins to enjoy working with Ryan. Then one day, Ryan doesnt show up for work. Things get rough when Toby finds out that Ryans life before this service tech job was not quite so innocent: he was involved in the world of drugs, and his former partner was stabbed twenty-seven times.  Was Ryan the one who murdered him? This was a great story that never slowed down. It made me laugh, and its characters were some of the zaniest Ive ever run across. The authors descriptions of the utter grossness of the places they made service calls to made me laugh and cringe at the same time. I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Brian McGilloway is widely known for his Irish Borderlands thrillers featuring Inspector Devlin. In his latest book Little Girl Lost he introduced to his readers DS Lucy Black, who is working at the Public Protection Unit and had written an other real bestseller. Now DS Lucy Black returns in \"Hurt\", an entangled thriller that shows once more how the young and vulnerable can fall prey to those they should normally trust blindly. Everything is about the abuse of power. A sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on a train line one freezing December night in Derry. Only because the theft of copper cables the incoming train couldn't run over her and so a murder is discovered which had to seem a suicide of a desperate teenager. Detective Sargent Lucy Black is called to identify the body of the murdered girl as Karen Hughes. As Lucy delves deeper in to the case, she discovers that Karen has been living in residential care the child of an alcoholic mother and a father behind bars. The only clue as to the girl's movements are her mobile phone and various social media sites - where her 'friends' are not all friendly - quite the opposite! A very interesting beginning of a book which looks - after the first 7 chapters - very promising. I have yet preordered it for my kindle. \"Hurt\" is coming out on November, 21. The extract also includes the bonus DS Lucy Black and Inspector Devlin short story \"The Sacrifice\": Right in the middle of the ancient fort Griann of Aileach in County Donegal, Ireland, the body of a tanned man is stretched out like a sacrifice, with countless wounds, like from a heavy beating. And ha has some Morocco coins in his purse. From an elderly driver whose car was damaged by an other car \"driving like followed by demons\" DS Black gets the license plate number. So they arrive at the driver of the other car. And a story emerges, which gives the word \"sacrifice\" an entirely new meaning... A very sad, griping story, but with some solace in it. And again we learn that not everything is like it looks.</td><td>\"Hurt\" - the First Seven Chapters plus...</td><td>1.3788576E9</td><td>2013-09-11</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>2013-09-11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>372</td><td>2084</td><td>-0.034278587266392144</td></tr><tr><td>67093371</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A2QA5L9WUYVATT</td><td>B0006AYGDG</td><td>L.

Peterson</td><td>I first encountered the work of Rubenstein as I was researching the Christian apophatic and mystical tradition. She has written several articles on ps. Dionysius, especially his history of ressourcement by figures like Hans Urs Von Balthasar, Jean-Luc Marion, and Jacques Derrida  It was much to my surprise, then, that I saw she had published a book on the philosophical and theological history of the multiverse.  And what a book it is.  Initially skeptical (interdisciplinary works are fantastic opportunities both to stretch our horizons, and for embarrassing dilettantism), I was delighted to find how engaging and learned this book was. Her prose remains whimsical to the end, even as it is ornamented by hundreds of footnotes.  And the learned journey she takes us on starts with the pre-Socratics, through Patristic and Medieval literature, into Renaissance, Reformation, Romanticism, up through the current maelstrom of scientific discussion regarding things with fabulously cryptic names like 11-dimensional Minkowski space-time, the cyclical ekpyrotic universes of Steinhardt and Turok, to Lee Smolin's idea that black holes are like terrifying Russian Nesting dolls, with new universes tucked inside their omnivorous bellies. (Lets get the elephant in the room out of the way: yes, it is deliciously ironic that someone named \"Mary-Jane\" would be the one to lead us on this delirious journey). I will focus in this review particularly on the history, for this is (to my mind) the most wonderful aspect of how she frames her tale. Regardless of how outlandish the current science seems, its options in other ways fall more or less neatly into spectrums anticipated by traditional philosophical and theological discussion.  She begins her journey by using Plato as a jumping-off point.  Alfred North Whitehead's bon mot that Western Philosophy is merely a footnote to Plato applies as well to many forms of current multi-verse theory, it seems.  Looking at Plato's Timaeus (a creation account that has incidentally been used to great effect in Christian theology) she wants to point out that though Plato explicitly emphasized the unity of the world, and is pained to prove that there could only be one world, multiplicity keeps slipping by Plato's bouncers to show up to the party.  This unity/multiplicity schema is of course not new; anyone who has taken a Philosophy 101 course will have no doubt encountered the usual fare of comparing and contrasting Parmenides and Heraclitus. While these two seminal figures appear, the primary contrast in Rubenstein's narrative falls more to the proprietary conflicts between Atomists and Stoics.  Said much too simply: these two groups represent whether multiple worlds are \"external\" to one another (\"external cosmic multiplicity\", as Rubenstein names the Atomist menagerie) or whether, more akin to the Stoics, there is a single world repeated in endless cycles.  Later we will see that this same dichotomy is repeated in the discussions regarding whether one picks up on the three types of Multiple-World Hypotheses (imaginatively named type One, Two, and Three), or whether one prefers their universes like they do their castles: bouncy, (though one might want to keep the endless cycle of inflation and collapse away from the castle, because won't somebody think of the children?).  The game of pick-your-infinite has been going on for quite some time, it seems. While Augustine would later reject Atomist cosmology of multiple external worlds (his effective strategy amounting to little more than never talking about it again after raising the point that yes, some do, in fact, believe in said position), Augustine spends most of his energy refuting the cosmic cycles of the Stoics.  His horror at the notion of cosmogonic \"do-overs\" is palpable; it would both \"reset\" eternal salvation, as it were, and cause Christ to be re-crucified God knows how many times.  Rubenstein humorously notes as such that his argument against the Stoics is not so much a (theo-)logical refutation as it is \"an extended expression of discomfort.\"  \"Who could listen to this?\" asks Augustine, and one can almost hear the anxiety in his voice as he pens De Civitate Dei.  \"Who could believe it?  Who could even tolerate it?\" The next 1300 years of virtual silence on Stoic cosmology seems to indicate the Western tradition had the good sense to understand that his questions were, in fact, rhetorical. We should certainly cut Augustine some slack, though, for--putting aside the fact that Rubenstein has obviously exaggerated the lack of argument in Augustine--if Augustine was horrified, even the Stoic's themselves were often embarrassed by the ekpyrotic (literally \"from the fire\") cycling of the universe that their theory implied.  Cicero mentions it once, only to never bring it up again.  Why?  Following the work of Mircea Eliade, Rubenstein theorizes that such an eternal \"undoing\" would not go over well with the political elites of Rome.  For the mythos of an \"eternal city\" would be hard to maintain if one's cosmology said otherwise.  On the other hand, as the story goes, when Alexander the Great heard the Atomist theory of an infinite plurality of worlds, he is reputed to have fallen on his knees and wept \"for he had not yet conquered even one.\"  Our cosmological imaginations have political upshot, says Rubenstein.  And if I had a complaint about this book it is that she does not follow her own fabulous insight more fully.  Soul-City-Cosmos-God; these have always been mutually implicating in the history of thought.  The denigration of theology in our current secular society (and perhaps the denigration of reason itself) is that precisely because we imagine ourselves to be secular we hide the still all-too-real connections between what we believe (or disbelieve, as is increasingly common) regarding one or more of these entities. Discussion of multiple worlds became en vogue again in the Medieval tradition, not so much because either Stoicism or Atomism revived, but with the rediscovery of Aristotle's texts his opponents (themselves encoded in Aristotle's texts) became ghostly figures demanding exorcism.  Many worlds became a thinkable position despite this, especially with the rejection of Aristotelianism (which followed their master in arguing vehemently--though not consistently, as Rubenstein points out--against the possibility of multiple worlds on the basis of Aristotle's physics) in the \"Condemnation of 1277\" which rendered anathema anyone who said that God could not make multiple (even infinite) worlds.  It was God's absolute omnipotence that was at stake: whereas for Aristotle it was deemed a physical impossibility that multiple worlds could exist, such physical constraint should hardly bother an omnipotent God, reasoned Etienne Tempier, the Bishop of Paris responsible for the condemnatory list. Such reasoning was followed famously by Nicole Oresme and Jean Buriden, who used such reasoning to create the entire genre of the scientific use of counterfactual reasoning (such as imagining a frictionless plane) which even led to the suggestion that the earth was not the center of the solar system (gasp!) and rotated on its axis (which to them seemed more elegant than saying, with Ptolemy and Aristotle, that the whole universe made an ungainly revolution around the earth in a 24-hour period).  For an in-depth exposition on this check out Amos Funkenstein's groundbreaking work on \"Theology and the Scientific Imagination.\"  Few, however, ever asserted the reality of multiple worlds; it remained a curious experiment of thought which opened pathways to vistas the Stagirite's physics had slapped \"dead end\" signs all over. In fact with Nicholas of Cusa and Giordanno Bruno, if God did not create an infinite number of worlds, this would be a denigration of God's glory and power.  (Cusa has, incidentally, garnered quite a bit of discussion recently because he is such a fascinating figure. I've had the pleasure of reading Johannes Hoff's The Analogical Turn and Michael Moore's Nicholas of Cusa and the Kairos of Modernity, and will \"rapid review\" them in the coming days.  In the meantime head over to Syndicate Theology's absolutely fantastic symposium on Hoff's book, in which Moore also participates).  Here with Cusa and Bruno comes the true \"Copernican revolution\"; for though the geo-centric cosmos had been ousted from its firm position where Aristotle and Ptolemy had staked it, for Copernicus the universe remained irreducibly finite. Its far edges were still impassably bound by the circulature of fixed stars.  From here Rubenstein discusses many others like Descartes, including a previously unknown manuscript by Immanuel Kant called Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (Kant wrote this when he was just 31, but as soon as it was finished the publisher went bankrupt and held on to all the copies). \"It had to wait for more than a century for its true greatness to be appreciated.\" Kant is in fact startlingly prescient with many of his theories--envisioning something akin to the \"Nebular hypothesis\" of solar-system formation, for example.  Kant envisions an infinite amount of galaxies that are themselves like \"stars\" entwining and forming a sublimely enormous superstructure  or \"meta-galaxy.\"  In a startling profusion of images and ideas (which thoroughly contradicts his later and much more famous work in the three Critiques) Rubenstein notes that this early forgotten work of Kant tries to combine all the elements of both Atomism and Stoicism.  Whereas in his later critiques he will warn others that they should not try to leave the tight confines of the \"islands of reason\" to set forth into the misty twilight world that lay beyond, here Kant is quite confident in his own powers of inquiry as they are wedded to Isaac Newton, and that his \"dangerous journey\" through the cosmos has led him to see the \"promontories of new lands.\" But we are threatening here to lengthen this \"short review\" too far.  This is a fantastic work on the history of ideas, and Rubenstein does an excellent job demonstrating both how old ideas (however much we forget this) still shape even the most cutting-edge scientific projects, but also that the way we envision the cosmos is not neutral, but has political ramifications.  This is important--and will be our parting thought--for Rubenstein in the final chapter elaborates how many of the theoretical speculations of modern science--however much they also have mathematical and possibly even empirical correlates--share a fuzzy borderland with philosophy and theology.  For of course in part the Many-World's hypothesis (MWH) was born out of an urgent need to explain the so-called \"Cosmological Constant,\" which appeared so incredibly fine-tuned one needed a \"Get-out-of-Theism\" free card.  Augustines \"who could believe it?  Who could even stand it?\" is perhaps the rallying cry of many who now see the MWH as the only possible recourse (as the atheist Richard Lewontin said a while back--my paraphrase--we accept the conclusions of naturalism, no matter how absurd, for me mustn't allow a divine foot in the door.)  And yet, as Rubenstein shows, the MWH has antecedents in theological and philosophical history.  This is not to collapse the distinction between doing theology and doing mathematics or empirical work in science (may it never be!); it is rather to show that speculation on many worlds has never been alien to Christian thought--it was in certain forms even promoted by it.  For just as there are many worlds that we have yet to see, the rich worlds of theological history lay behind us, waiting to uncover the lost histories that texture our thought even now. While this may not be the book to buy if you are wanting the focus to be an in-depth looks regarding current theory (I would recommend Brian Greene's work for that), this is a fantastic example of how the history of ideas can illumine how to understand the present.</td><td>A Wonderful Book</td><td>1.4815872E9</td><td>2016-12-13</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>1961</td><td>12019</td><td>0.11914231601731601</td></tr><tr><td>67096532</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1HT3NUW5J4CHJ</td><td>1619212390</td><td>JJP</td><td>excellent book I loved it.

I came to care for the characters and that is very risky in this harsh dystopian world Montano has dreamt up in many nightmares and populated with violent creatures beyond description.  I believe his major strength as an author is in the characterizations; as we get to know each layered and conflicted player  in the saga it brings great depth and commits the reader to the long journey. Watching Danica mature and become a fully actualized hero was awesome.  Cross was a dystopian Ulysses and his journey was often tediously tortured as he soldiered on in his quest to save the world and finally get the girl.  I became very attached to Ronan who was extremely well personified. In the end, it all turns out a great deal better, although not for all of our loved characters.  Then again, why would it?  In a world of stark terror and blood baths every few pages, we probably got as good an ending as we had a right to.

Cooper Jackson, my sort-of boyfriend, hadn't shown up or even called for the last two days. Cooper was the main reason I was still hanging around Lottawatah, Oklahoma, population 1452 living souls and a couple of dozen in spirit-world transit. I'd met more than a few of those since I'd arrived in town.\" Meet Brianna Sullivan, a psychic who lives in her motor home. Cooper Jackson is a local cop. Before Brianna even has breakfast she's confronted by a ghost named Martha who, it will turn out, may be Cooper's ex-girl friend. She was murdered about 20 years ago, judging by the price of milk. (Martha is wearing a supermarket checkout uniform and announces that the week's milk special is 75 cents a quart.) It gets this funny, frothy novella off to a brisk start. Cooper shows up to invite Brianna to his high school reunion - football, barbeque and beer. And that's just for starters. Add 33 partygoers including the ghost, attempted murder, a suspect on the lam, revelation of some nasty secrets, and you get a boatload of surprises at a not-necessarily-typical high school reunion on a hot August weekend.

This was prior to the recent fiascos that have dominated gaming news (No Man's Sky, Mass Effect Andomreda), though I would say it's issues aren't necessarily any less in intensity. First of all, there was no transparency on what this product included in terms of DLC. They were intentionally vague about what would, and wouldn't, be included. However, we were led to believe that the combined quality and quantity of the content would be comparable to say Enemy Within (the expansion for the reimagined Xcom, this game's predecessor; both of which received exceptionally high amounts of praise, and they deserved it). What we received instead was largely cosmetic content, and despite being cosmetic content that was bought at a premium price, it's quality was dubious. Indeed, there were Day One Cosmetic Mods available of sufficiently higher caliber than the DLC purportedly created by a First Party Studio (that they charged money for). In fact, all but the final DLC released for the reinforcement pack (which is why this Deluxe Edition has an increased cost) received distressingly low scores on Steam from users. The final DLC piece was well appraised, it was the caliber of gear that we expected, no, demanded. Out of the content released, only one was not cosmetic, and that was a relatively small pack at that. It added a new class (which was cool), a new scenario, and was of a reasonable caliber of quality. It was comparable to the average mod, which is far surpassing it's peers. I should rephrase this, the Alien Hunters dlc is technically not an exclusive cosmetic pack, but I am including it thusly as that's what was primarily included in it. It added a few extra weapons (that you receive almost from the start; they aren't that innovative either), some new armors (which require you to kill a boss-enemy, extremely annoying enemies that will wipe your groups early, appear via RNG, and are easily slain if you progress farther into the game), and the boss enemies themselves of course. None of which were that innovative, and appeared to be at about the level of a low-quality mod, largely uninspired content is a theme for this company it appears. Onto the actual game itself, on release it was impaired by severe graphical and stability issues. That is, my computer which consists of parts that are all in the 97th-99th percentile (a great computer), would struggle to run the game at times? There were weird issues that would result in you losing your group members (which really ruins your day if you're playing on Ironman) from nothing, like the ground literally vanishing beneath their feet, a giant black hole situated there instead, that resulted in instant death + gear lost. There were the quality of life issues, soldiers hitting glass that doesn't exist, shooting through solid objects to hit targets, weird camera issues, etc. However, what about now? Well, the stability issues have been reduced (though are largely still a great impediment), the graphical issues are a bit better, and the bugs are mostly gone (though I've still had people die from stupid stuff, it's nowhere near as weird as before). The story is mediocre, though the randomized map creation software (similar to Minecraft) keeps it somewhat fresh, allowing for a greater degree in map variety. The soundtrack isn't memorable, but isn't terrible either. The balance of enemies isn't too bad either. Gear progression (better weapons/armors) is pretty bad to be honest, very few options in that, and very linear progression. The weapon modification system (add a x item for y improvement) adds a bit more variability, and the ability to name weapons (and retrieve them after a character dies) is a good addition. Overall, the game itself is average, maybe a 5-6. The DLC practices (which are why you would be buying the Deluxe Edition in the first place) are abhorrent, DO NOT BUY THE DELUXE EDITION OR THE REINFORCEMENT PACK! Ultimately, due to the terrible DLC policy and quality, I cannot in good faith recommend this game in the slightest bit. I surely can't recommend the Deluxe edition that exists only to peddle poor quality DLC that is largely worse than the mods available for free on Steam.</td><td>Dishonest Practices and Quality Issues Severely Impede an Otherwise Average Game; DO NOT BUY THIS</td><td>1.5025824E9</td><td>2017-08-13</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>2017-04-29</td><td>106</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>723</td><td>4285</td><td>0.03231154714850369</td></tr><tr><td>67100722</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A28JUAOBYBNP1A</td><td>B0140JE03O</td><td>Brandee Crisp</td><td>Although this was a short story, almost a novella, it was as powerful as a novel could be.

In the first volume, entitled Charlie Muffin and published and set in 1977, Charlie is already middle aged with a long career as a spy behind him.  Yet in the most recent works, published and set in 2013, he is still middle aged and still spying. As others have noted, the plots are of variable quality.  Most have a twist or two on the last page.  These often result from some furtive action Charlie took, almost unnoticed by the reader, once his survival instincts warned him of impending danger. In this case, Charlie, for the moment not a spy, represents a Lloyds of London insurance syndicate who have insured a unique and priceless stamp collection.  A drug \"kingpin\" wants to steal the collection and the FBI want him to succeed so that they can then raid his home, find the stolen stamps, and arrest the man.  It's the Al Capone plot: if you can't get him for what makes him rich get him for how he misuses his wealth.  However, rather than bringing the insurers inside the tent, the FBI maintains secrecy.  Once Charlie works out some of what's going on he sets in train a series of events that totally disrupt everyone's plans. In the closing chapters the robbers, a group of Cuban soldiers (working for the Russians), the FBI, and the local police are involved in a massive, and wholly unbelievable, shoot-out and Charlie quietly vanishes.

I've read most of his work and consider myself a fan but this story was so imaginative that the premise alone gets five stars.  I'm gonna do one of those idiot things and recommend this to \"everyone.\" (Nothing has ever been written that could possibly please everyone but I'm going with it anyway.) This wasn't too heavy on the horror aspect; it was actually more sci-fi - but not too heavy there either.  I'll call it \"Near Future Speculative Fiction That Blew My Ass Away.\" Therefore it gets recommended to everyone.  It tackles contemporary and frightenly real near-future possibilities.

It would be helpful to read some of Rav Laitman's other works, like Kabbalah for Beginners, before diving into this 400+ page book, as much for background and terminology as understanding.

It feels like ceramic and aluminium.  It doesn't feel, or sound, like wood.  It has a clink to it.  I want to mention this because if you are expecting something that has the feel of wood, this does not.  I'm trying to get a good answer on this- when/if I do I'll update this review. It is GORGEOUS and I love it.  The finish is shiny and beautiful - I love the lines.  The shape is natural and just striking, and the fact that it is silver means that it goes perfectly with many different other pieces that I have, as well as my flatware.  When I turn it over, I see the LENOX on the bottom and the metal looks like it has been molten and poured- it reminds me of looking at the backs of some custom gold jewelry I have.  As a serving piece, it's really eye catching.  It would make a great gift.  It holds enough for a family.  The bowl is a bit small for a large group, but it should be okay with a full table of other offerings. It holds crackers and cheese dip, or chip and dip, or several other types of appetizers.  It says that if using a more acidic dip that you can spray it with oil to help keep the finish looking great.  If the finish does cloud, they recommend using baking soda to polish it with. It comes with a Lenox Replacement Program card, where items can be replaced for 1/2 price if broken.  That gives me the choice of mailing off a card or just registering online.

If you're a fan, you don't need a long-winded review. You know it's good. And if you haven't read these two authors, especially their Liaden series, you've missed a sure thing. There are 16 superb novels in the Liaden Universe. The Tomorrow Log stands alone, while we wait anxiously for a sequel. Lowport, Dragontide, and the other short story collections are an excellent place to start, if you want to cautiously enter this magic pool.  Magic, because you believe: you believe the characters, the events, the intricate world/universe - and you like them. They are admirable: they have all the traits we'd want in our family and friends. They never give up; they present a united, defendable front; they reach for the far goals; they are responsible and responsive; and they are FUN. You know they've got your back.  Clan Korval [the Dragon] lives in a hard place where the usual rules apply: [from Saltation] \"Always know where your ship is and in what state. Always carry an extra weapon--this assuming one always carries two weapons to begin with--your extra is preferably one you are willing to use for a last stand. Be prepared to fight . . . but be prepared also to run and to be small, for a dead, jailed or administratively restricted pilot flies no ship. When you walk in strange places be aware of those who may follow you, and though sitting with your back to the wall is useful, it is not always sufficient. Always know more than you tell, and share all of your secrets, even on your deathbed, only with those who will properly treasure them.\" Melant'i, the outward expression of the code of honor by which Liadens live, is a form of expressive personal honor including the balancing of oneself and one's actions within the existing framework, according to one's honor and one's circumstances: always evidencing the proper mode of behavior to express the inner truth, I suppose is close, and demonstrating one's actual worth. It reminds me of ancient Japanese formalized honor requirements. But the most important aspect to me is that one meets one's own standards, and is responsible for oneself. Like every other book they've written, Miller and Lee beautifully demonstrate this in the light of Tinsori.</td><td>Boy, does this light SHINE!</td><td>1.359072E9</td><td>2013-01-25</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>390</td><td>2269</td><td>0.17905618686868685</td></tr><tr><td>67102940</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A39KXJ204FE10Q</td><td>B01GKAYI7Y</td><td>Andrew</td><td>fits my closet perfects. enough room in each shelf for large mens shoes, running shoes, dress shoes, etc.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1.4751072E9</td><td>2016-09-29</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>18</td><td>105</td><td>0.10714285714285714</td></tr><tr><td>67103172</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1YSO18VEDA5SB</td><td>B01F9FAMBW</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Absolutely loved it couldn't put it down.

Tempani of Amarill is the main character and a very strong, self-sufficient one at that. I found her enduring spirit a nice change and felt that she stayed true to her character profile throughout the story. She is a half-breed and is on the receiving end of a lot of hate and contempt and she is forced to enter and live in royal circles. She dreams of the two races of Kamara being joined as a free and accepting people, but her dream seems like an impossibility. A prophecy is revealed and the magic that she was born with is more powerful than she imagined. Nic, the prince of Kamara, has fallen madly in love with Tempani, but will this be enough to clear all the obstacles? Tempani is faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles and difficult decisions, time will tell if she is making the right choices for not only herself, but the future of Kamara. This is a book filled with adventure, fast-paced action, friendships, intrigue and a relateable characters.

I have watched Ana and her family deal with trials and tribulations and heartbreak, and come out stronger.  I love watching the unconditional love, support and encouragement Ana and her husband give their children and I have enjoyed watching the twins grow up into amazing independent people.  In this sixth book of the series, Clio manages to overcome some serious trouble with the help of her ex-Seal bodyguard.  The science background is very interesting and seems to be meticulously researched (as usual), and I am in awe of how Clios healing ability has matured.  I anxiously await the arrival of the new cousins and how it will affect the lives of the Mendez family!

I got a free ARC and the original synopsis looked good. I like YA, but I have never read a YA book with a predominantly Black/African-American cast of characters. I sincerely hope this book does not represent the the entire sub genre. It was inane, insipid and incredibly ignorant (or ig as the characters often said...more on that in a bit). Antonio, whom I can only describe as the main male character as he was no man or hero, comes across as vapid and stereotypical. Ditto the female lead Meisha. They are both so unlikable that when they have their first conversation (nearly half way through the unnecessarily long book) I couldn't believe they would even be drawn to each other. I know they are supposed to be young, but aside from being attractive- and the author beats us over the head with how sexy/fine/big a**ed/pretty eyed/well built the pair of them are- they are never charming or sweet or even kind. All they do is mouth off, threaten, proposition and brag. Why would anyone pay to read about these people? \"Read\" being a relative term in this case. I felt like I need a passport and a \"what in the actual f?\" to English dictionary. I am only in my twenties so it cannot be an age thing and I've long since left my clutching pearls alone while reading YA. Trying to decided what they were talking about between the shortening of words (like ig) and the overuse of slang (some sentences looked like gibberish) was tiring. Female characters were referred to as \"ho\" and \"trick\" so often that I would have to go back a bit just to figure out which \"trick\" was the topic at hand.

I'm a long-time admirer of Gotham Chopra's father, Deepak; and I loved experiencing this look into their daily family interactions.  We could all use a good laugh, and I gratefully had several out-loud chuckles from the book.  Gotham has a great sense of humor. What is it like having Deepak as a father?  \"While our existence in the cosmic context is barely a parenthesis in eternity, at times it can seem interminable for those of us enduring it. So we seek ways to distract ourselves\".  This was my favorite Deepak quote from the book, and surely answers the question of what it's like to have a spiritual counselor for a father. I would have loved having this family in my life...a family of souls definitely brought together by the cosmos to create something special for themselves and for the rest uf us too.  A sense of cosmic fate played out at its best with such love, peace, intelligence.  Go Gotham! I bet you have a few more great books up your sleeve. One of the main characters in this story is Gotham's dog, Cleo.  I hoped the book would steer away from a tragic re-telling of Cleo's demise in her old age.

It is actually quite normal for some.  Sometimes when betrayal hits, women have a way of pushing it down, try to keep the relationship for the love and the man and push down their own feelings. After a while it builds up a deep well of resentment & anger and can go unchecked and unrealized for a long time. Then one day something will trigger it.  So I can see how and why this took so long.  Even though it happened 10 yrs back for Rose, who might have thought it was dealt was in actuality her just compartmentalizing and filing it away, leading a an eruption of emotions and feelings that never were resolved so its till very fresh and real.  She needs to process through it all to get across it.  So no downing on Rose. Every women process s*** differently and in their ways.  Unhealthy but there it is.

Author Rebecca Dickson confidently thinks so, and her thoughtfully researched and beautifully illustrated new edition Jane Austen: An Illustrated Treasury is quite a persuasive testament. Any doubting Thomas' will be hard pressed to argue against the evidence skillfully presented in this volume. Not only are the carefully chosen Regency era images complementary to her expertly written text, the overall friendly and visually appealing design and its incredible value place it as my number one choice of Jane Austen inspired books of 2008. Surprisingly, this volume is not just a fluffy image gallery packed with pretty pictures. Rebecca Dickson is an Austen scholar and instructor of writing and literature at the University of Colorado at Boulder with a doctorate in English Literature with a specialty in eighteenth-century writers. A professed Austen enthusiast since reading Pride and Prejudice in High School, Dickson has written an inspiring tribute to her favorite author geared to the everyman reader. Her style is open and engaging and I never once felt the scholarly mantle descend to befuddle the text. The opening introduction and short biography are followed by six chapters devoted to each of Jane Austen's major novels: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. Within each novel chapter, Dickson not only discusses the novel's plot, characters, highlights and impact on classic literature, but places it in context to Jane Austen's life and her times. In the chapter on Pride and Prejudice for instance, she has included its publishing evolution from first draft in 1797 as First Impressions, to Austen's father's failed attempt at publication, to its final acceptance and publication sixteen years later in 1813, interweaving the changes in Austen's life and her financial situation adding impact and interest. Interspersed throughout the chapter are quotes from the text acting like `fact bites' emphasizing important points. The images selected stunningly present illustrations from Austen's novels by the late Victorian artists Hugh Thomson, C.E. and H.M. Brock, vintage paintings and contemporary movie stills. The surprise bonus is removable reproductions of actual documents ranging from copies of handwritten letters by Jane Austen to a page of the rough draft of Persuasion. My one disappointment (and it is a trifle) is in the cover design which is adequately pretty, but has nothing to do with Jane Austen, nor adds any Regency era feel or interest to entice buyers to open, explore and purchase this book. Given the length of thoughtful research and numerous images included in this glorious edition, one hopes that buyers will truly not judge its value by its cover. Highly giftable as an introduction to Jane Austen or as a tribute to the indoctrinated Janeite, reading this lovely volume will leave few in doubt of Jane Austen's position as pop-culture icon and literary genius.

I just recently bought a set of knives that are very vibrant, primary colors and frankly, it seemed a shame to relegate them to the plastic bin where I keep all of our sharp knives. (I don't keep them in a drawer because I have grand kids.) With this product I am now able to display my pretty knives. I honestly wasn't certain it would work. I most certainly wouldn't want it to give out and have a sharp knife falling where it could hurt someone. So I was pleasantly surprised to find this bar is heavy and sturdy and the magnetic pull is super strong. My husband is quite handy and it took him no time at all to hang the bar, using the screws and reinforcements that are included in the package. It probably would have taken me a bit longer but I don't think it would be difficult for anyone with a drill to hang. My knives look beautiful up on my kitchen wall and I am not worried about mishaps.

Its got some predictable things but not too bad. The characters are all odd balls which are fine, but sometimes the sappiness for 1 particular member of their party is over the top. There are some inconsistencies on some of the charactersthey are goodno waitthey are badno, they are pretty good people. Turns out some of these characters were not good people, but in the end were good. One girl in the story was very nurturing yet she used to sell drugsyet she was a B@%ch...but she was nicebut waitshe has a mean streakuntil a 7 year old smiles. Weird stuff like that. It gives the neck whiplash on characters flip flopping. There are the typical non-gun slang like CLIPS instead of magazine being usedwhich tells me either the daughter of a military man does not know something so simple or her dad was a boneheador it was the author(s) not knowing the difference. There are numerous typos and incorrect grammar. I would have paid for a professional to edit this. For example: Despite this, she had tried to lay with her Jaces arms around her. This is a classic example of terrible grammar that a professional editor could pick up on. The story will saunter through a scene then jump as if by a hyper-dimensional doorway to another scene and I had to go back to the last sentence to see what the writer was trying to say. SPOILER ALERT: Ok, there is a scene near the end of the book where the good guys are trying to sneak up on the bad guy so they stop only  of a mile away and set up shopmake a camp fire, make coffee and I am wondering how these guys are still alive the next morning? The characters cannot think either strategically or tactically. The 7 year old prodigy doesnt think of this? She can think 10 steps ahead of everyone else but even she fails. I know shes 7 but if she can paint like Rembrandt on a window and it looks like a picture, think 10-20 steps ahead of everyone and then make a master planhow can she fail in this critical area? Not sure what the author(s) were thinking. Charlie did something weird Charlie fed everyone with her usual style and flair, at least as much as one could afford in the zombie apocalypse. Okwhy is the girl who is militant, a beserker feeding everyone when Byron is the cook? There are many irregularities and personality traits shifting back and forth between characters. Byron had already been introduced as the cookso why is Charlie, a tom-boy taking a traditional role in cooking? The positives: The characters and story have great promise but failed in many areas. I would fix several things. I love the zombie king! That was very creative.

Robert Emmett, who was nine years old when he got polio in 1952, clearly shows the impact his disease had, and still has, but he does this without making polio or his physical handicaps the center of his life. It was always there  from the first diagnosis through isolation, hospitalization, subsequent surgeries, and even the more recent onset of post-polio syndrome, including new weakness, falls, and broken bones  but he managed to make polio only one part of an interesting, successful life rather than the focus. Three Quick Steps includes vivid descriptions of his treatments and shows his feelings about the many activities he couldn't do that others took for granted, but it also has warm memories of friends and family members in settings and activities that are unrelated to his medical situation. His education and career experiences are an interesting read even without the backdrop of polio problems; the physical challenges make his lifes accomplishments that much more impressive. There is no woe is me attitude nor any attempt to sentimentalize the events of history. Rather, this is a straight forward account of a man who overcame significant challenges with his fiercely independent nature and his will to succeed. Because post-polio syndrome has no cure, this book doesnt have a typical happily-ever-after ending. Instead it gives the reader a deep sense of the joy to be had in living life to the fullest, regardless of setbacks.</td><td>Gives the reader a deep sense of the joy to be had in living life to the fullest, regardless of setbacks.</td><td>1.4242176E9</td><td>2015-02-18</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>257</td><td>1560</td><td>0.250094696969697</td></tr><tr><td>67115105</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A3HEG0QCOK446R</td><td>B01GQPYQ0W</td><td>Snowbunny1977</td><td>Its been awhile since I've read one of her books.

In each, the author describes the book in simple terms. There is a woman who must decide between lovers. The reader imagines a main character with her arms outstretched, a different woman holding and tugging each hand. We know there will be conflict. We know emotions are going to run high. But what I love about Sheree L. Greer's writing is that it isn't just the main character being pulled and tugged in different directions. As a reader, I am also presented with unexpected choices, opportunities to consider and reconsider my assumptions and expectations. Days after finishing this book, I am still wrestling with the conflict. Toya is the main character of A Return to Arms, but the book is not really about her. Toya channels the Black Lives Matter movement, and through Toya we see many different people coming together and pulling apart, creating and destroying, loving and hating, hurting and healing. It won't be what you think it will be. No matter who you are. No matter where you stand, there will be pieces in A Return to Arms that will move you out of your comfort zone. It presents complexity where we might prefer simplicity, but the truth in the complexity is undeniable so we allow it to take hold. I want more writing like this in the world. <3</td><td>Complex, Moving, Unforgettable</td><td>1.4729472E9</td><td>2016-09-04</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>2015-08-05</td><td>396</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>242</td><td>1353</td><td>0.23966666666666664</td></tr><tr><td>67118610</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>AC4XS2SQAHQ17</td><td>B01DBIROQ0</td><td>camille</td><td>I was really excited for this but it's too difficult to open a can.

However, Micro violates many laws of physics, biology and probably several other scientific disciplines. Even with willful suspension of disbelief, this book is not entertaining. The middle section consists of pages and pages (and pages and pages and pages) about entomology. Then the plot gets more and more incredible, the characters go from 2-dimensional to zero-dimensional caricatures. (If the authors can violate natural laws, so can I.) The plot devolves into utter nonsense. You might think it can't get worse but it does. It's written as a screen play (except for the interminable pages about bugs). The text is devoted to pointless action that does not advance the plot at all but describes violence and gore in excruciatingly boring detail.

This is a story that starts quick and never really lets up. It is the time of the Vikings. Rikard and his tribe are out fighting enemies when they are confronted by a witch's army. Rikard has a vision of his death. When the army they are fighting comes back to life, Rikard dies. His lover Bera stitches him back together into a draugr, a kind of Viking Frankenstein monster, and sends him out to kill the witch. Rikard finds there are two witches. As Rikard fights, he finds that his new body needs mending, so his appearance changes and becomes more gruesome over the course of the story. Rikard's father wants this thing that was his son dead. Rikard just wants to finish the war with the two witches. Supernatural Vikings fighting the undead? Count me in! And it's a good story. The art by Joelle Jones is perfect for the story.

Ms. Starr takes on that challenge in BELLE GONE BAD, and scores a 5-star read, proving that anything is possible and nothing is quite what it seems in the Old West. Set in 1884 in Delaware Bend, Texas, one of the toughest towns in the Old West, BELLE GONE BAD is the story of Belle Thompson and Mercy Huntingdon. When Belle meets Mercy she takes an instant disliking to the artist who is better known for his sensual, erotic wood carvings of ladies on saloon bar furniture than his skill with a gun. Belle, who is on the hunt for her father's and ex-fiance's killer, has no time for such a free spirit while the trail she is tracking is growing cold. But when a friend, convinces Belle to help Mercy track down his missing muse, Belle discovers that there is more to Mercy than meets the eye. Soon Belle and Mercy are taken on a trail of discovery that includes secrets of each character's past, a spiritual reawakening, the sensual freedom of \"Free Love\" and an appreciation for forgiveness and how the releasing of prior guilt is an essential element to the ability to fully open up to love. I commend Ms. Starr for reversing the typical stereotypes that are so pervasive in romantic literature. Belle Gone Bad demonstrates that not all heroes and heroines need to fit the typical mold for a love story to work. I also loved the rich, vivid detail with which BELLE GONE BAD describes the Old West and its outlaws, bounty hunters, saloons, \"outlaw towns\" and even Indian religious influences and the motivation driving the migration west. You can tell that Ms. Starr really did her research before writing this historical western romance, and it greatly adds to the allure and intrigue of the story! I highly recommend BELLE GONE BAD to anyone who loves a good western romance or strong heroines!

It starts off clich, and the protagonist, Leona, annoyed me many times. But the concept of the mythology is very interesting. Translucent has been a great introduction into Dan Rix and his writing. I must admit, the cover is what attracted me to this book  and don't get confused  there is another novel by Lauren Bird Horowitz with a very similar cover. (Why do publishers do that?) But once I read the blurb, the addition of sci-fi and an alien substance that you can wear ding- Im sold and this title was instantly added to my cart for checkout. Our protagonist Leona. While I loved reading her story and the narrative style, I did not agree with many of her decisions. I understood her reasoning, but her actions had me shaking my head many times  but hey, it made good reading. We see some kind of arc and character development for her, (and then everything is left up in the air.) Leona, is tormented with guilt. With a fantastic back story which is unravelled throughout the course of the novel, you are able to see this history influencing many of her decisions. Even though she is not my favourite character, she is definitely well written. Megan (the best friend) felt like my best mate. She embodied all the idiocy that we had in high school. And, while not the voice of reason, was genuinely looking out for both her and Leona. I was a little disappointed that her story line had dropped away towards the end. Without Megan Translucent would have been considerably less entertaining. Emory, Leonas love interest, felt the least convincing character  I felt there was not a lot that justified his actions. Was he sad? Was he a bad boy? Why was he so predatory with Leona? I wanted more insight into his psyche in order to relate to him. Maybe well get more in the following books, maybe we wont. But Im on the fence with Emory. While there is resolution at the conclusion of Translucent, I wanted more of a solid ending (though I do like a good cliff-hanger). There was a bit too much left hanging for me to feel totally satisfied  even if it is the first in a series its the first in a four book series (at the time this review is being published.). It was as successful as many other debut novels. But I nonetheless was hooked, and really enjoyed the experience, devouring the novel in a day. Im planning on reading Of Starlight in the next few weeks and see if Dan Rix is going to hook me as another must have author. Its something I would recommend, but don't expect amazing things; though the whole dark matter-invisibility thing is cool.</td><td>An alien encounter of a different kind</td><td>1.4557536E9</td><td>2016-02-18</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>2015-11-15</td><td>95</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>473</td><td>2591</td><td>0.23380952380952377</td></tr><tr><td>67121167</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1LE8A5ZIRQ1JI</td><td>1482748916</td><td>bumslie22</td><td>I loved this book!

Ashling Boru is 16 years old and has been protected and hidden all of her life, not only because of a prophecy that she will unite all of the wolves but because her father is afraid of her. Unlike other wolves who aren't able to shift until puberty, she was born being able to shift. Ashlings life really starts when she is taken to Port Harbor, Maine. She learns a lot about herself and her kind that has been kept from herand she meets Grey. She and Grey fall deeply in love instantly. How can a wolf and a human survive as a couple? And what about the prophecy that shell be claimed by a wolf? I don't usually care much for reading about werewolves but I am delighted that I decided to read this series. Aurora Whittet has built a world that is similar to ours but also has a culture of werewolves who have their own ancient traditions and are here to protect humans. The characters are well developed and I enjoyed learning their stories. There were times I had to remind myself that Ashling is only sixteen because of the way she reacts to some situations. It was difficult to put Bloodmark down once I got into it. It is full of mystery, intrigue, horror and, most of all, young love.

Their friendship is really unusual with her being a almost completely friendless nerdy freshman that gets pick on and him being a punk rocker and one of the most popular guys in school. I think every girl has had that one guy best friend that they've secretly crushed on for years without ever being noticed. But what if one day he does notice you? That's the beginning to this series and I loved it. Even after being separated for 2 yrs when Jacob leaves for college in London Beth never loses her feelings for him. When she decides to accompany his mom on a visit and surprise him the summer before she starts college she couldn't have imagined the way it would turn out. But when her trip is cut short and she heads home Jacob shows how much she means to him even if he hadn't realized it all along. This story was just adorable and I couldn't put it down, finishing it in just hours. I love the way Jacob is protective of Beth and the playfulness of their friendship. My only issue's with it was during their high school years the time line would jump around without warning. Also the constant switching of the pov took some getting used to as it mostly would just happen suddenly. I was given an ebook from the author through Nerdy Girl in exchange for a honest opinion.

As a child of the sixties, I recalled our being part of that time, watching my then wife collapsing, exhausted, after nursing our son, as we built our house and participated in the movement, thinking it was all possible, yet so unaware of the cost.

It was the cover of this book that first attracted me. I had all but forgotten this illustration but the moment I saw it the memories came flooding back - my grandfather had a framed print of this painting hanging in his study  and as a child, it both intrigued and frightened me a little, the prince and princess astride a wolf racing through a dark forbidding forest.

This is Lucy's story. She's the only daughter and the youngest of the five Graylocke siblings. Three of her older brothers are spies for the Crown and they've always tried to keep this information from her, but being curious and not a fool, she's figured this out during past few months. This book starts 3 months after the last book ends where Lucy unwittingly has come face to face with the elusive Monsieur V, the French spy master that England has been searching for, for so long. Lucy intercepts a message meant for her eldest brother, Morgan, and decides to try to find Monsieur V on her own because she's the only one who's seen his face and can identify him. Alexander Douglass, the Marquess of Brackley, has a reputation as a rogue or rake, but upon the sudden deaths of his father and brother the year before, he changed his drinking and womanizing ways and has been helping England's spy network. When he finds out what Lucy Graylocke is up to he takes it upon himself to keep her safe, since her brothers would never want her involved in the espionage game. Of course they end up falling for each other. One of the things I liked about this particular story was the sex scene wasn't detailed about how he touched her and where, unlike the previous 4 books. I thought the storyline dragged a little because Lucy is a young woman and has to have a chaperone whenever she's out in public. She can't just up and go somewhere, she has to come up with excuses to disappear. Also, I wish there would've been a way to refer to Monsieur V besides saying Monsieur V constantly. One chapter mentioned his name a ridiculous amount of times. I was kind of let down at the ending. I wanted to find out who Monsieur V was, what was his background, etc, but we don't find any of that out. All we find out is the reason no one can identify him or remember anything about him. There's another book in the series which tells Charlie's (Miss Charlotte Vale) story.</td><td>Lucy Graylocke's story</td><td>1.5058656E9</td><td>2017-09-20</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2017-04-08</td><td>165</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>377</td><td>2052</td><td>0.0466111111111111</td></tr><tr><td>67130369</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>AUMQXZYHHW2VN</td><td>1940215498</td><td>Newf Mom</td><td>This is the first book I've read of this author.

Why do I have to get a headache to get enlightenment?  These are some of the answers you will not get reading this book.  While I love to read about ancient cultures and religions I do not like being put to sleep while someone pontificates on their belief structure.  I will never understand why people who want me to believe in or at least understand their religion have to explain it in such a complicated way.  Do I need to be spoon fed doctrine? NO.  Should there be a struggle for understanding?

They're supposed to be adults, but behave like children. There are constant overreactions to any problem that comes up. These books also seem to be filled with people keeping things from each other, which leads to problems and break ups. Over and over again. You don't keep important information from someone you love or you lose all trust and credibility. And you usually don't get it back. The characters in this series are so dysfunctional that I'm sad for the world if people actually act this way. I should have stopped after book one, which ended up semi HEA, after an extremely abrupt, but finally got back together ending. From reading the reviews for the rest of the books, (thru #51), there are a lot of cliffhangers. I know that in the 1-3 box set there are definitely cliffhangers. Not acceptable for the author to not explain this. From what I've read of the reviews, the stories keep getting shorter and shorter as well. I have to say that the only reason I read the rest of the box set is because I was so appalled at the characters' behavior, and the disbelief that people might actually act that way, that I had to see if that got any better. *Spoilers* This probably bothered me more than anything else. Cayson, who was supposed to be the best out of all the guys, used a girl until the one he really wanted became available. Then he immediately dumped her. SO not acceptable. Then C gets upset with his girlfriend's brother when the other guy has a night with her. He acted like he was jealous and cared way too much for someone he just used. Although I think upset is too mild a word. He was more like highly irrational. Way too much emotion for the supposedly (on his part) mean nothing relationship. And then he was ready to break up with his girlfriend over her being bothered about his insane behavior? He was more than willing to throw away his girlfriend and a lifelong friendship over someone he supposedly didn't love? No. What sane person would act that way? Skye annoyed me as well. She knows she has to be careful trusting people because of her father's money, but she isn't careful, and she gets fooled until someone tells her what's going on. The guy keeps bothering her off and on, (which was dragged out and not resolved over the three books I read.) But she's so arrogant that she thinks she can handle anything, even a man that weighs twice as much as her. I can't stand arrogant stupidity in any character, so this really bothered me. In regards to C, she didn't know she loved him until he had given up on her and was with someone else. Trite. Plus, not only did he say unforgivable things to her after his insanity with her brother, she took him right back and never questioned his attachment to the other girl. Where's her self respect? Pretty much the only character I really cared for was Slade. He was a lot of fun. As an aside, I do have to say, that Slade's dad yanking a snow covered branch from a tree and setting it on fire it immediately with a lighter so he could scare a bear away was ridiculous.</td><td>This review covers the three book box set.</td><td>1.5023232E9</td><td>2017-08-10</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2015-03-24</td><td>870</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>569</td><td>3108</td><td>0.08573489010989013</td></tr><tr><td>67132106</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AQVP0HCB19P5I</td><td>1482616599</td><td>Josephine greene</td><td>This has been a delight to read.</td><td>Excellant reading for anyone.</td><td>1.429488E9</td><td>2015-04-20</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>32</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>67132509</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AYKC1V3YVXSRO</td><td>B00CTSA7BI</td><td>Mary E. Trimble</td><td>In 1973, when Joyce Burke drives her 1967 Volkswagen from Chicago to Yellowstone National Park, she is thrilled with the freedom of the open road, yet apprehensive about leaving all that is familiar, her family and a fianc. She has accepted a seasonal job at the park, knows no one and doesn't even know for sure what her job will be, other than the vague description Food and Beverage Clerk. During the peak of the park season, Yellowstone employs 1,500 people. Would she fit in? As she drives further west, her initial exuberance and confidence are challenged-her car isn't running quite right, she's weary, a little homesick, and wonders if she's doing the right thing. But, she sticks with her plan. She arrives amidst the confusion of new arrivals getting their work and housing assignments. Joyce meets her roommate and together they explore. In time they become friends with others in their same situation. They name themselves \"Yellowstone Savages\" and find joy in this great park with its abundance of wildlife and rugged scenery. Author Lohse does an outstanding job of bringing the reader into her life as a fledgling in unfamiliar territory, developing into a woman of confidence and compassion. She's game to try new things, but retains her basic values. She experiences true, lasting friendships, is given additional responsibilities at work, and learns first-hand about the beautiful but fragile life cycle of wildlife and the wonder of the spectacular landscape of Yellowstone. I highly recommend this book. Lohse's experience makes a fascinating read. This e-version is the 25th Anniversary Revised Edition and contains pictures the original book did not have. It took courage to do what the author did, and courage to write about her experiences with such honesty. The book offers great insight into Yellowstone, America's first national park, and the behind-the-scenes stories of what it takes to maintain it.</td><td>A fascinating read</td><td>1.375056E9</td><td>2013-07-29</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2013-04-24</td><td>96</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>313</td><td>1928</td><td>0.2434892451298701</td></tr><tr><td>67133131</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A34YO4U0WFJW3D</td><td>1939863023</td><td>Anjena</td><td>This was a reread and since I didn't rate it last time I will now.

A baby farmer who bought babies given up by their families before placing them with adoptive parents for a fee, she was accused of murdering children in her care and disposing of their bodies. This book is based on facts gathered from trial transcripts, records, newspaper reports, etc, but tells the from Minnie's point of view. In her version the babies and children accidently died and she panicked and buried the bodies in the garden.  This is plausible as the infant mortality rate was high in the 1890s and she was viewed with enough suspicion by the authorities that she would be in serious trouble.  Society in 1890 was male focused and anyone different was frowned upon.  By today's standards there was reasonable doubt but things were different then. This book is thought-provoking and very well written, showing another side to the story.  I knew of the crime growing up and always thought Minnie Dean was an evil monster who went around smothering babies and got what she deserved.  Now I think this is another David Bain case and you'll never be sure of her guilt.  This is a good read though the historical facts are a bit dry and slow going.  I'm not sure how interesting the case will be to international readers but it does show how life was back then for pioneers.</td><td>The Day She Cradled Me - Sacha De Bazin</td><td>1.3598496E9</td><td>2013-02-03</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2012-10-26</td><td>100</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>246</td><td>1354</td><td>0.04984189723320158</td></tr><tr><td>67133192</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1T01R5KLUQ447</td><td>2080301454</td><td>N.

I read it in 1969 when I was about 13 years old, but re-reading it now, I realise how much of it was away over my head. Not only has my head changed since then, but so have the times. Yet, the message comes out very clear in a way that only became popular later on: Humanity can't be trusted. Robert Fairlie is an expert in languages, ancient and modern. He has been asked to help with a project for what he thought was the Smithsonian Institution. Instead, on disembarking at the air terminal, he's picked up and driven to a top  secret facility in the New Mexico desert. I suppose you guessed it -- it's a pre-Neil Armstrong we've-landed-on-the-moon story. On the moon, they made a shocking discovery: someone's been there already. Thousands of years ago, actually. There are the ruins of what was a space port and evidence that it was destroyed in an attack. Enough relics are found to enable scientists to recreate one of their space ships, but no one understands how they work, or where they're from. There's documentation, but in a totally unknown language. Also, voice recordings that play back on a strange machine they happened to find in one piece. That's why Robert Fairlie and other linguists were drafted. Deciphering a language with no known references is nearly impossible. Almost ready to give up, Robert tries one more idea that has been plaguing him. Some of the syntax of the language reminded him of ancient Sumerian. He follows that lead, and sure enough... The ancient astronauts are the ancestors of humanity -- Earth humanity, that is. Humans didn't start on Earth. What's more, they locate the original planet of humanity. Now able to read the how-to manuals, they get the ship into working order. The bulk of the narrative is the trip to a planet across the galaxy. Of course, Robert Fairlie has to go along, as someone has to talk to the people there. One question remains, which is why the project seems so urgent. Who destroyed the base on the moon? Who was the enemy even more advanced and high tech than the ancestors of the Sumerians? Before it became a Hollywood scriptwriter's cliche, Edmond Hamilton characterised DeWitt as the military heavyweight who's going to run roughshod over any obstacle to American interests. Christensen is the more level headed scientist who knows that there are more important things at stake. If it seems like an old and dusty scenario, give him the benefit. It was a much more fresh and daring thing to write in Edmond Hamilton's time. It was first published in 1960. When I first read it, America was still the good guy, playing the hero in Vietnam, \"with God on our side\". Military men were always depicted as knights in shining armour. Think John Wayne. Contrary to one of the other reviews I've read on the Amazon review page, it wasn't a tired cliche when Hamilton wrote it. As it is, Hamilton presented a very well narrated story of human imperialism then and now. Who destroyed the base on the moon? Someone who knew that humanity couldn't be trusted.</td><td>Humanity can't be trusted</td><td>1.449792E9</td><td>2015-12-11</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2015-11-25</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>536</td><td>3056</td><td>0.07617052881758767</td></tr><tr><td>67133416</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3OSDBTWLU1UZ0</td><td>1941325262</td><td>Frances M.

I'm unsure of the exact time period, but I'm guessing it is in the late 70's or 80s, given some of the text (eg, looters stealing VCRs, the main character being a Vietnam vet, and people sending telegrams). So this is likely either a previously unpublished work, or deliberately set then (I suspect the former). The plot revolves around an ancient evil being awoken from a long hidden burial site, uncovered by a new construction site. The reference to Zombies in this book isn't your typical zombies. I'd more personally classify them as possessed, like a huge plague of characters from the Exorcist. Which I think is a new plot to me, and I think probably more frightening. Zombie plagues are a dime a dozen these days (not that its a bad thing, I love them), but the take in this story is actually unique in my excessive reading in the genre. For those of you, like me, who note that this is \"Bloodscreams #3\", and \"Bloodscreams #2\" isn't available on audiobook, the book stands alone on itself, with only minor references to the prior novels. There are no real times when you are wondering what some past reference is about, as you may on a trilogy of interconnected novels coming in at part 3. The narration by Robert DeVoe was top rate, very easy to listen too, and I'll be looking for future books read by him. There were some minor mispronunciations, but more for uncommon terms that I've personally pronounced incorrectly myself (eg, Goethe). I'd be keen to hear the entire loose trilogy on audio, so I'll be keeping an eye open for part 2.</td><td>Fast Supernatural Action Story</td><td>1.4078016E9</td><td>2014-08-12</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>290</td><td>1619</td><td>0.061069134117914606</td></tr><tr><td>67133536</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A2N339DTKXO3JR</td><td>8482670948</td><td>Jesus*Loves*U</td><td>Great book !!

As a satire, these stories are a success, although my opinions of each vary. Severance Coffee is about a workaholic woman who is just about too busy to be fired. Several situations stood out to me: one, the workaholic who thinks she's single-handedly keeping the business afloat; two, the lack of communication between the company's leaders (and between them and the employee); and three, the disconnect between white collar and blue collar workers. This one was a bit depressing, because I felt sorry for the lady being fired. The \"older you get, the less you work, the more you earn\" paradox is a story about a young man who takes a chance and asks for a raise. His boss denies the request until he's \"older in the company\" and basically says try again in 2053. In response, the man decides to play a prank on his boss and recruits his best friend and girlfriend to assist him in his elaborate plot. I thought the prank was pretty clever, funny, and a little over the top, but this is satire so over the top is appropriate. The forgotten chosen one is the last of the three stories. It features an OCD intern who arrives to work on his first day extremely motivated and ready to work only to be shuffled aside, ignored and ultimately forgotten. There's an ironic and fantastical twist at the end which I won't go into due to spoilers, but in my opinion it wraps the story up well. This was my favorite of the three stories because it made me chuckle, definitely the most clever of the three. Personally, I would have preferred more short stories in a single eBook. The three here got me interested, but I felt like it was just getting started when I turned the last page. Also, there are some spelling errors and maybe one or two punctuation errors, but in my opinion, they aren't of a nature to be a distraction unless punctuation and grammar errors are a pet peeve. Overall, I enjoyed Working for Heat and would recommend it to anyone who likes satire and a really quick read.

Not a moment sooner will it come; not a moment later will it be delayed.  `As You will, what You will, when You will' (Thomas a Kempis).\" \"Conferences `with flesh and blood' are most subtle hindrances to Christian determination. `What will the world say?  If I go too far, I shall give offense; I shall lose all my influence, and blast all my prospects of eventual benefit to those around me.'  The apprehension also of losing the affection and of incurring the displeasure of those whom my heart holds dear, is most fearful.  And then this sacrifice is too costly to make; that pleasure too hard to resign.  Such thoughts -- the injections of the tempter -- are ever at the door; and even when effectual resistance is offered, the struggle is most severe.  But it is such a mighty help in this conflict, when one desire has taken sole possession of the heart, `Lord, what will You have me to do?' -- when we are so crucified to worldly influence, whether of pleasure, profit, fear, or esteem, as to be ready to act upon the resolution, `Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh.'  Now the heavenly beauty of the religion of the gospel breaks in upon us.\" \"The lack of a determined choice is the secret of the halting profession that prevails among us.  A compromise is attempted with the world.  `The offense of the cross' begins to `cease.'  A middle path of serious religion is marked out, divested of what is called needless offensiveness.  But the religion that pleases the world will never be acceptable with God; nor can the religion that pleases God, be ever accommodated to the inclination of the world.  Oh! we shall do well to consider, whether the way of the Lord's precepts may not be found too hard, too strait, too unfrequented; whether we are prepared to brave the pointed finger and whispered scoff of the ungodly, and perhaps the mistaken opposition of beloved friends. Often has the profession of Christ been hastily taken up and relinquished.  He who wishes to abide by it, must daily learn this lesson, `Without Me you can do nothing:' and in conscious helplessness, he will often breathe the cry -- Let Your hand help me.\"</td><td>genev</td><td>1.3297824E9</td><td>2012-02-21</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>464</td><td>2554</td><td>0.027499999999999993</td></tr><tr><td>67137278</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>APBPK3TBFBM8X</td><td>B00Q7UR050</td><td>leon olsovi</td><td>OKAY</td><td>NOT TOO INSPIRING</td><td>1.4341536E9</td><td>2015-06-13</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>67137320</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A3O75UKOIPZSAI</td><td>B000EELCNG</td><td>Sunrise</td><td>I'm just learning but I think it will be great.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1.413504E9</td><td>2014-10-17</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2014-07-15</td><td>94</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>47</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>67137357</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A1LGS1XSDVXINP</td><td>B00D09TPV8</td><td>Jo Mama</td><td>I gave episode 11 five stars.

With one of the daughters, Peggy, proving successful at professions including fur broker, self-trained physician, and schoolteacher, this forward-thinking family manages to play out their lives on the frontier in a series of dramatic incidents. Some of the attitudes seem more modern and politically correct than would have been likely for the times, but not gratingly so. The author deftly weaves together details that might be unfamiliar to readers, such as the Celtic heritage of the Appalachians as exhibited in mountain dulcimer music.

Plus, it has lots of general information on traveling in Cambodia including a section on Phnom Penh.  If you are doing a basic Cambodia visit of Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, then this book is all you really need. My only complaint is that it is a big book, bigger than other tour books like Lonely Planet or Rough Guide.  This is a problem if you are trying to travel as light as possible.  However, I still recommend taking it. A general suggestion for visiting the temples: be aware that they are now apparently the second most visited tourist destination in Asia.  Lots of Asian tour groups everywhere.  To avoid them, go early!  Get going at 6AM (or even earlier and go see the sunrise over Angkor Wat!). Then you'll have the temples to yourself for a couple of hours.  Midday, when the tours go back to their hotels for lunch is also good, as is late afternoon/early evening.

Lil dude was truly something else and I loved how he, along with Barracuda handled anything that tried harming them or the ones they loved. Starburst was beyond trifling and I couldn't believe how far she was willing to go instead of leaving things alone. I did feel bad for Devin because once things began looking up, it was easily turned upside down. With Agent Shane I was hoping he would just kill himself instead of acting like a bitch. He should've just accepted the fact he got caught slipping instead of holding a grudge. I didn't like Majnoon's sneaky behind either and Carlos actually thought he was doing something. Seattle lending a hand when it was needed the most helped and she handled directions very well. Oh Helen don't be playing any games and had her mans back through it all. Raider is my dude with his crazy ass. Slow Poke and Iron Head proved their usefulness as well, even though they faced a few challenges along the way. I'm glad an alternate ending was provided in which both had their own pros and cons. I must say Tacoma was definitely selfish in how he handled things and didn't take the what ifs into consideration. I understood his reasoning but he neglected everything he'd been told concerning the matter.

Rose Darvey was supposed to keep track of the case results.  She thought the lawyers were congenital idiots.  She was only nineteen.  Helen's boyfriend was Geoffrey Bailey of the police. Logo was a road sweeper.  Logo was acquitted according to Helen West because one can't cross-examine a person who sings hymns.  Logo's neighbors became forced to understand that there was no societal provision for dealing with someone half-mad. A superior wants Helen to speak with the clerk, Rose, since all the young policemen are wild for her and are fightling over her.  At some stage Rose and Helen develop a friendship.

Coldwell</td><td>Alaskan adventure lovers, lace up your boots, fill up your water bottle, and get stoked for a colorful mystery in the Final Frontier as you dive into Hinchinbrooks Hunted. This is book three in P. Wesley Lundburgs Frank Mattituck series. Mattituck is a charter boat captain and occasional deputy trooper who has been officially deputized by Alaska State Trooper Todd Benson on a murder case. Todd calls upon Mattituck when he needs his boating expertise, an extra pair of hands, or just a smart guy to have around. When Justin Harris is killed by his friend, Wilson Garrett, while out hunting, it looks like a tragic accident. As Todd assesses the scene, however, his eye catches something that doesnt jive with the story Garrett told.  Benson shares his doubts with Mattituck, and his deputized friend agrees to accompany him to the site.  Frank proves to have good instincts, but is it more than that? Todd is vaguely aware of his buddys military experience, but to this point, Mattituck has kept it all pretty buttoned up. He must have gone through some heavy-duty action, because he says little about his past. Yet, the training and experience serves him well as he treks through the woods with Benson looking for clues. Monica Castle, an attorney who is Franks girlfriend, also plays a prominent role in this mystery novel. Her client, Tara Garrett, was the wife and business partner of the dead man. Monicas professional relationship with Tara puts her between an ethical rock and a hard place, as she knows things that she cannot reveal to her lover and his trooper partner. We get to see how intelligent and diligent Monica is as she does her own digging into Tara and Wilsons business history and the couples relationship with Justin Harris. Will what she discovers give her a loophole toward exposing possible criminal activity on the part of her client? As in previous Mattituck books, Wes Lundburg fills the pages with marvelous descriptions of charter fishing exploits and rugged scenery. He has a keen eye for detail, and when it comes to conversation and dialogue, he nails it. Irish brogue, musical Italian accent, rough and tumble Alaskan  he does it all. There is some wonderful humor, as well as nail-biting tension. This author really likes his cat-and-mouse tracking scenes; if you're someone who likes this too, you probably will enjoy Hinchinbrooks Hunted. We also get to see more of Trooper Bensons skills as a cop and as a wilderness tracker. Hes got sharp instincts and natural abilities that are well suited for exactly this kind of case. I enjoyed watching him in action and seeing him developed more as a character in this series. Oh, and did I mention infidelity? Theres just a wee bit of mistrust going on in this book that makes for some angst all around. Our heroes are right in the thick of things, too. On the other hand, number of things did not work as well, I felt. We don't know a lot about Mattitucks background, and I was hoping for more details. Stay tuned, I guess, because we got peeks and teasers this time around. I got the impression, however, that he saw some awful stuff. So it surprised me that during the marathon hunting expedition with Todd that he didn't exercise better judgment when Todd suffered a head injury and became confused.  The biggest doubt, for me, is once again, the Uhing.  I expected a larger presence and more detail about their interest in Mattituck. We are introduced to a new agent, and this leads indirectly to an interesting scenario involving this agent, Monica, and Mattituck. I have Mr. Lundburgs word for it that this is going somewhere in future books, but as far as HH goes, it seemed weak. As for Monica and the agent  I was shocked by Monicas initial reaction. Yes, shes human, but that was unexpected. A bit of background to explain her hurt feelings might have helped, perhaps in the form of introspection as she fumed and hurt. But I was more than satisfied with the conclusion of that incident. None of those things is enough to dissuade me from eagerly awaiting the arrival of the next Mattituck mystery adventure, as I find this series very entertaining and like the authors style quite well.

The Upside: -The authors wade into uncharted waters attempting to add nuanced understanding to issues (especially the issue of bisexuality) that are often hit with a club and left unexplored or unexplained -They substantiate the infinite uniquenes of individual sexuality; the only predictor of a person's orientation, attractions, desires, emotional affection, excitement, motivations, etc...is each person for themselves -There's a nice balance to the mix of the anecdotal, case study, clinical, humorous, hawty, etc... situations involving unique, sometimes surprising self definitions...emergy spontaneously and frequently. As soon as you've figured out the nuanced category in which to place a given person, five more people pop up representing 5 new shades needing a new definition The Downside: -For all their effort, they still manage to leave out important chunks normative sexual expression that were calling out to be included; -The authors would be well served to create a Bell Curve  mechanism that continually pops up to remind readers that every human characteritic, trait, behavior, sex act, emotion....all occur across a spectrum of responses/variaitions and we should be inclusive of those broad ranges no matter what we are talking about -The book is very readable....helpful for grad students, confused spouses, clinicians, humorists...there's something for everyone Overall I think its worth the read, just don't get bent out of shape when you read the five things that you don't agree with...sexual orientation and identity aren't about agreement, they're about self realization, authenticity, and self-worth, not external validation</td><td>Worth the read, warts and all</td><td>1.4458176E9</td><td>2015-10-26</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2015-07-26</td><td>92</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>251</td><td>1697</td><td>0.1864090909090909</td></tr><tr><td>67145154</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A1F63OSS2ZF85Y</td><td>1539375757</td><td>Wildkat</td><td>Very good read.

Justin is a vampire working for the Chronologic Touring Agency and he likes to pretend he is human.  Neither wants to admit that they are falling for each other but when another vampire threatens their relationship, Justin risks screwing with time to keep her.  Adan is a vampire from the past and he's falling for Deonne and he's pleasantly surprised when he meets the vampire she's in love with. The author continues to bring this fantastic and unique series to life.  The plot is intriguing and flows smoothly from one complex layer to another without confusing the readers and keeping their attention from beginning to end.  There are lots of twists and turns and lots of suspense that keeps the readers on the edge of their seat and the strong compelling characters are easily related to.  The author paints a very vivid picture of each setting in this futuristic world and conveys all the emotions and motivations of the characters with a depth that makes the reader feel as if they are part of this fascinating adventure. This tempestuous read radiates heat with lots of lots of sizzling sex scenes, menage, anal sex and sexy alpha heroes.  Justin, Deonne, and Adan's relationship is inspiring and stimulating with lots of drama to add depth to an amazing story. There is never a dull moment in this book or in the series. While each book focuses on a specific threesome, each book also follows the lives of several different characters and conflicts at once.

But let me try. Pinkie and Blueboy, the title, refers to the two famous paintings at the Huntington Library in California. The paintings themselves are famous for many reasonsone is not related to the other, but as fate would have it, they ended up at the Library, mounted side by side, and the meanings they represent continue to inspire, awe and intrigue people. Now, two teens, Davey and Sarah, happens to view the said paintings at the same time, and this encounter intertwines them somehow, so much that later in life, after decades fly by, they meet in very different circumstancessituations that one would describe as jaws-dropping. I have read Holy Ghost Writers previous books, mostly based on Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo (Pinkie and Blueboy is supposedly the fifth one in the series), but I have to say that this latest book is my most favourite.

Two compelling lead characters, a story with a number of twists that caught me by surprise, plus some excellent steamy scenes all combined to make this a fun thriller-romance. Eve Caplin is a woman with a very expensive art collection and a nefarious past; she's now moved to sleepy coastal Central California to try to get away from that past and make a new future for herself. (For those who enjoy heist TV: think of a genderflipped Neil Caffrey from White Collar and you've got the picture.) Through a turn of events she meets Hudson Cleary, famous (and devastatingly handsome) painter. Hudson hasn't painted in two years, and he's dealing with his own past. Eve is a super-capable woman who doesn't melt into a puddle of goo in a crisis, but she's also believably conflicted and somewhat brittle due to her hard life. Hudson at first seems too good to be true - is there anyplace the man DOESN'T volunteer at? - but as the story rolls on, we learn there's a reason for it. He's got a gentle, quiet strength that doesn't require him to be dominating. He lets Eve take the lead when it's her area of expertise, but he can step up when it's needed. And boy, does he ever step up. Side note, the sex scenes. Oh, wow, the sex scenes. Let's just leave it at that...oh wow! The caper-thriller story is just as solid as the romance, and both the main characters and the community they live in are well drawn and believable.

It drew me in right away and then I didn't want to put it down. I love a story that lets me see into a character's heart and soul. Dredging Up Memories does this very well. At times, I wondered if the main character, Walker, is crazyhis friendship with Humphrey??but it didn't matter. Crazy or not, he is so human...so fallible. AJ Brown's story has more depth than most zombie apocalypse books; it's almost philosophical in parts. Everyone the main character comes across has an impact, leaves him with new lessons learned. In this sense, it reminded me of The Little Princeonly much darker and filled with zombies. What impressed me most about Dredging Up Memories is the high level of talent Brown shows in his writing. When I finished this book, I immediately got another story by AJ Brown. I'm still reading it, but it's proving to be just as compelling and well-written as this one. One final comment: I found it interesting that Brown was able to write a ZA story without using obscene language. I'm not a prude when it comes to language, but this was refreshing.</td><td>This is Talent</td><td>1.4651712E9</td><td>2016-06-06</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2014-08-09</td><td>667</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>209</td><td>1166</td><td>0.2243689874939875</td></tr><tr><td>67148567</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A354UUUW8RNR4Z</td><td>8925597853</td><td>Christina Rose</td><td>Its very awesome about his first 5 years.

Although the style fits the time in which it took place, it's a bit stilted. The part that deals with the two battles which took place is true, in fact one of the characters who appears at the end was actually an ancestor of mine although not one I'm particularly proud of.  It's a story of a Crusade, but one that was fought against the citizens of France rather than the infidels of the Holy Land.  It tells of Pope Innocent III and his fight to subdue two factions, the Albigenses and the Valdenses, whom he declared to be Heretics as they would not submit to the rule of the Church. The two main characters are a Knight, Andreas,  whose desire is to go to the Holy Land and a woman, Eva, who is a visionary, one of those considered to be a heretic. Their stories are told separately but they overlap towards the end although they don't actually meet, at least not in person. It's not a love story, but rather an accounting of two events that took place in the year 1209 - one which annihilated the entire population of one town and the other which displaced the population of the entire city of Carcassonne. Once I got into it, it was hard to put it down. The stories of both the main characters was captivating and I was actually sorry to see it end. If you're a fan of historical fiction, you will really like this and as far as I can tell it follows the actual history of the battles quite accurately. It's not a book I'd recommend to everyone but as I said, anyone who has an interest in that era is in for a really good read.

Because we know all this as readers I found myself antsy that Amanda, Frank, Mike and others were not putting the pieces together fast enough. Had they, this book would have been shorter and not as good. I especially liked the very end when Mike talks about how this case affects a death sentenced case.

He put the story into the authors head. Also, what happened, hasn't happened yet. This is a unique read in so many ways, and I loved it. Eight-limbed spiders rule the Multiverse. Humans (yeng) are an enslaved species, and also provide delicious meat to the Aranians. The narrative is written in third person, and shows the POV shifts clearly most of the time. Occasionally, Orlando Oversight will add commentary. Some of the dialogue can be a bit long in the tooth, but that is what Spider Aranian Boklung is famous for. The character development, world building, plot, and pacing are all done well, and this was a book that pulled me into its pages. The ending is open, and I can see the possibility for a sequel here. There are lessons to be learned within this fun read, and more than a little allegory. If you love sci-fi, alien worlds, even a bit of romance, then you're bound to love this book.

The good news is that Powell drastically improved his exposition skills in this novel.  The bad news is that he cut dialogue way back. But its worse than that.  This novel is essentially the story of Jenkins party-going years as a young man.  It should have dazzled.  Instead, it fizzled. I think I found the problem.  Toward the end, theres a brief interaction between Jenkins and his friend Barnby.  Why is this interaction so engaging?  Its because Barnby is a coherent, straightforward person who paints, goes on dates and does other concrete things.  He likes to talk.  In other words, hes interesting. But Powell is trying hard to sell Kenneth Widmerpool to us.  The problem is that Widmerpool is a snore.  Hes an ambitious man with no apparent personality.  Not only is too much of this novel devoted to him, but theres an explosion of new characters, most of them Widmerpool-like and interchangeable, including the women. If Powells point was that most people are like Widmerpool, Im sure that the point has been amply made by now and I hope that in the next novel in the series we can move on.

The books protagonist, Sadie Weinstein, is a quirky amateur detective who becomes the object of suspicion in a Floridian beauty school murder. Sadie enlists the help of her husband Nathan, and her eccentric psychic and friend Rhajmah to find the true killer and keep Sadie out of jail.  The antics and characters described in the book are nothing short of hilarious! This is not the great American novel or anything if you're looking for something deep and/or thought-provoking. However, this book is a quick, entertaining read that is sure to brighten even the darkest moods. The setting and characters are very-well described and developed.  With likable characters and a comfortable atmosphere, it was a great weekend read that made me eagerly anticipate the murderer reveal. You will be kept guessing of who did it until the very end. This is a cute story and evidently one of three in a series featuring the same main character. Sadie Weinstein is an adorable, blundering amateur sleuth that is sure to bring more laughs than hard-hiting gumshoeing. Overall, I rate this book a five out of five and will absolutely be purchasing the companion books to this hilarious story.</td><td>This is not the great American novel or anything if you're looking for something ...</td><td>1.4935968E9</td><td>2017-05-01</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>215</td><td>1274</td><td>0.26750000000000007</td></tr><tr><td>67159124</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>AAKL15P5BEX7R</td><td>B004ZG7BMU</td><td>Robert C.

Only the influence of their elven mother in the ruling Council has kept them safe for so longbut now there are forces at work outside the borders of the elven lands that are beyond anyone's control.

The Heirs of Lydin is a YA fantasy story set amid vividly-drawn societiesthe powerful, arrogant civilisation of the elves, the feudal structure of the perennially warring humans, the scholarly Numoi, and many more. Aidan Hennessy has created a colourful, detailed backdrop for this first novel in the Ap'Lydin Chronicles. Unfortunately, I didn't find the character development was quite as convincing and enthralling as the world-building, with characters and dialogue that could, in places, have benefited from a little more depth.

Budden</td><td>\"Predator in Paradise\" is my third Shelter Somerset book.  I've read two of the three books in his \"Between Two Worlds\" series.  In \"Predator,\" Dwayne and Owen set out into the wilderness on a hiking trip, something they've done before, but this time--it's purpose is to attempt to repair their broken relationship.  They find themselves in a situation in which they're not only fighting for their relationship, but for their lives as well.  I found \"Predator in Paradise\" to be fast-moving, action-filled and suspenseful.  The skill with which Mr. Somerset creates the brink to which he brings these two is formidable.  I found myself hungry for more development of their troubled relationship though.  I couldn't quite grasp Dwayne's seeming resentment towards Owen--where it came from or what it was rooted in.  I was hoping to get more answers to this by the end, thinking their harrowing survival experience might push all of that to the forefront.  I was left wanting more psychological development between the two men in regards to their relationship.  In his \"Between Two Worlds\" series, Mr. Somerset handled the developing and sometimes troubled relationship with that couple superbly.  I was looking for the same thing here.  But it was still an enjoyable read and if you are one who likes to see how human beings handle themselves when pushed to the limits, you will get that here--in spades. On a broader note, I enjoy Mr. Somerset's books precisely because they show gay men overcoming obstacles to achieve their values.  So much of the gay world is fraught with nihilism and destruction for its own sake.  Its nice to finally get an author who rises above the clichd shallowness so many other authors of gay novels seem to engage in.

Some of this may come off as being nitpicky, and if you're offended, than I apologize. But I'm not sorry because the things that bothered me about this book took away from the joy of reading it. I was very taken aback that the heroine was ok with the fact that she not only woke up to five strange men in her home, but that she wasn't afraid of them, even though they had started a brawl mere hours earlier. Not one time did she ask how they knew where she lived. Since Curtis could have possibly been called a stalker legally, once she found out he had been coming to her job every weekend for two months, she should have logically thought that he had followed her home at least once. I suppose he could have gotten her address from her employer, but that just doesn't seem plausible. She never asked, so we'll never know how he knew where she lived. It was strange that she just went along for the ride, that she accepted his plan after knowing him for mere hours. I gave the book 3 stars because I enjoyed Curtis' backstory. There are relatively few things that irritate me more when reading any written work, even a simple Facebook post, that has been poorly researched. We live inn the age of the Now. Information, the correct and factual information, is available at an instant. I did not know anything about this author before I read this work. I quickly discovered that the author wasn't American. Now don't get me wrong, I have nothing against anti-American writer. One of my current favorites is Billy London of the UK. She writes for a wide audience, but she sets her stories in England and places she has either been to before or is familiar with through her travels or research. Ms. Watkins didn't do much research and it's obvious. Her usage of words like bin when she should have said garbage can or waste paperbasket  or  carpark instead of parking lot were mildly annoying. Those were just a few examples, but those are not words or phrases native speakers of American English use. The most egregious is when she said supreme court judge instead of Supreme Court Justice. It irked the life out of me. Google is your friend.

I'd say this belongs to the most ultimate category. Basically it's a sea story, but the writer also tells about the ordeals he went through on an  escape march through the Singapore jungles - before his ill fated voyage ends up in a lifeboat of a torpedoed ship, in the Indian Ocean. After the gruesome weeks of fighting for one's life, the writer's purgatory-like experiences continue in a Japanese prison camp. The laconic and barren style with what the story is told  can be seen as amateurish writing. On the other hand, the whole account is so utterly grim that this kind of writing kind of suits it. Considering  the events described in the book, one wonders how it all can be contained in a mere one hundred pages. This could easily have been a book of some 250-300 pages. However, if you're interested to read how far a man's endurance and will to live goes, you better read this one.</td><td>Quite ultimate survival story</td><td>1.2438144E9</td><td>2009-06-01</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>180</td><td>991</td><td>0.03665223665223666</td></tr><tr><td>67161969</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A25P93OL9EJWUT</td><td>1634764021</td><td>Jeanne</td><td>Honestly, I haven't finished this book yet.

I particularly gotten this book for the last(or one of the last stories).  It was a somewhat epilogue to another story.  It involved Mpreg(eggpreg?).  It was really going well and even went into how the egg was produced(through love).  But we never got to see them as parents.

Emma Horserider is an ex marine, and her name is so appropriate because of her bond with animals, especially the wild horses she loves so much. She has a telepathic connection to them. She is a dog and horse whisperer. The Native American mysticism crosses boundaries with the military and a bike riding hunk who goes by the name of Brandon Winchester. Terrorismenter Homeland Security in the form of Brandon Winchester. Emmas brother, Bert Blackfeather, is his boss and sends him to help her, after a herd of wild horses is attacked and she almost loses her life. Brandon is a remote viewer in the Anomaly Defense Division, think of the old CIA Paranormal experiments. He also has a telepathic connection to his cat, Gaucho. Sparks fly. I really enjoy the fun and flirty dialogue between them.   Dear God, how she loved an inked up wild man on a bike. The wild cast of characters quickly won over my heart. I laughed with them, feared for them, and hoped they would make it through the danger okay. I love the warrior women. Strong female characters appeal to me and Sharon Buchbinder gives us some doozies. The supporting cast is just as interesting.   Youre a Twerp whisperer Steph. Thanks for defusing the little hand grenade. I love her outrageous cousin, Stephanie. I wonderwill she have a story of her own? What do you say Sharon? When it becomes too dangerous for her to stay home, she moves, temporarily, to Hotel LaBelle. To get the full story on Lucius Stewart, Tallulah Thompson and her pug, Franny you will want to read The Haunting of Hotel LaBelle. Like fighting like, the upcoming battle hits close to home for both of them and Broncos past will come full circle. Full of so much goodness, so many of the things I love, danger, suspense, humor and sadness, lives lost and lives saved. The seriousness of the story still leaves time for humorous writing that keeps the pace flowing smoothly.

The same goes for this collection too. I loved the stories but do not quite know how to explain those. One thing I discovered reading the stories is that, most have endings which are open-ended. It is for the reader to decide how he or she wants to explain it. The stories depict the male point of view and cars are important part of the stories. The stories are about males and for males. Yet I loved the book. The title story sets the mood. The narrator goes to his neighbour's place to complain about noise and all but ends up bonding with the young boy and his friend by revealing about his brother. The narrators of each story end up knowing something other than what they expected. Sometimes the consequences are not so good. Many a times, things are not what we think or expect. Life will always throw a curve when we least expect it. I loved the build up of each of the stories, be it tragic or otherwise.

I would have found multiple trips to the world fascinating as the increasing threats by the evil Alexander plagued them prior to the ultimate outcome. I feel the multiple encounters with the people from the past, which all the women hold dear, could each be an individual episode when expanded into a novella.

Russell also weaves a strong learning component on every spread. She prompts kids to find words hidden in illustrations from printed vocabulary lists, making for perfect visual perception and vocabulary-building exercises. What Parents, Educators Will Like Activities at the back of the book, with suggestions for customizing tasks by age, extend learning for every level.

When a dealing rival starts slinging product in Low Town, the Warden makes calculating countermoves to lock his interests down tight. New to Polansky? Read the Low Town books. The Warden's cat and mouse play with lowlifes, and ineffectual elites amuse, but it's his checkered past with the notorious Black House -- a government agency of snakes, spies, and magic-enhanced practitioners -- that keeps him playing a very deep game.

Yes, theres a lot of genre play going on between these covers. The Night Marchers demonstrates plenty of conscious, thoughtfully trope-busting work, but I find myself most interested by the ways in which it deals with horroryes, seeing as Im a horror writer myself, Im probably (definitely) biased, but what can you do? Specifically, Im fascinated by this books recurring tensions, between sensitive, humanist character dynamics and that which absolutely and totally exceeds the human. Certainly, this tension arises often from the kind of mysticism described in the authors bio (consider Hurricane Sandrine,  Mystic Tryst, and Music of the Spheres, which is the collections strongest piece by far). What Braum repeatedly grapples with here is a genuinely difficult tensionhow to convey that which hovers just beyond, under, or above our comprehension while still adhering to the mechanics of character-driven prose fiction? Braum seems to enjoy this challenge, paying his respects to his multiple chosen genres while also bumping up, time and again, against the unthinkable. While reading these stories, I couldn't stop thinking about In the Dust of This Planet, the first volume in Eugene Thackers Horror of Philosophy series. In particular, I find myself returning to Thackers argument that what genre horror does do is it takes aim at the presuppositions of philosophical inquiry  that the world is always the world-for-us  and makes of those blind spots its central concern, expressing them not in abstract concepts but in a whole bestiary of impossible life forms  mists, blobs, slime, clouds, and muck. Braums book situates itself precisely in this genre-specific territory: his goal, it seems, is to render absolutely strange the world that surrounds his characters, dislocating and eventually blanking out their all-too-human concerns. This is not the world-for-us  this is the world we do not, and cannot, understand. This notion is expressed nowhere better than in the books second last (and second best) story, The Moon and the Mesa. The narrator comes to realize that the thing most frightening to him is not that which can be explained away by his human-centric concept of morality, but that which evades our moral systems altogether: Im filled with the oddest notion that a scorpion isn't evil. It just is. It stings and kills because it is its nature. So too does The Music of the Spheres capture the sense of a world (or, indeed, a universe) that maybe (probably) doesnt care about the human race one way or the other. Like several other entries in this book, this piece centrally figures music and musicians as a means of exploring human attempts to capture transcendent experience. The books horrific conclusion suggests that, as hard as we might try, whether through the techniques of mystic ritual or extreme music-making, we will ultimately buckle under the cosmoss indifferent demands. Heavy stuff, yeah. But I also think Braum deserves recognition for just what Ive highlighted above: he is a genre-crossing acrobat, and he couches his ideas within the well-executed spinning of yarn. These stories are genuinely surprising, strange, and unpredictable. Working with a geographically diverse set of plots, hes adept at portraying the sense of being lost and out of touch in unknown environments. Sometimes the book itself feels this waylike a new and unknown space, tantalizing but full of quietly and slowly emerging creepiness.</td><td>Making the World Strange in Daniel Braums The Night Marchers</td><td>1.5048288E9</td><td>2017-09-08</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2017-09-08</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>9</td><td>595</td><td>3730</td><td>0.04659534454616425</td></tr><tr><td>67165755</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A38IFYONHXG4BV</td><td>1784750948</td><td>M.Moore</td><td>The story line for basis of this book was WWII.

The answer required me to suspend my disbelief a little further than my sci-fi mind wanted to go, but all in all, a good story with engaging characters.</td><td>Well-written and exciting</td><td>1.4576544E9</td><td>2016-03-11</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>135</td><td>718</td><td>0.09085978835978835</td></tr><tr><td>67166469</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A1NDI7O9AJDD69</td><td>1416578692</td><td>Tina Pavlik</td><td>\"This was a great read filled with many giggle inducing moments as well as deeply touching ones.

J. Lewis</td><td>Because of how Mr. Kaufman structured \"The Kaufman Repertoire\" it is far superior to the vast majority of other repertoire books, and that's before you even get to the content. Most repertoire books take you through each major variation from A-Z before you move on to the next major variation, You will find you self being preparing for every reasonable response, throughout the tree, to the point where you find your self in positions that have appeared less than 25 times out of a database of 5 million games. Your chance of encountering this position is at this point, a fraction of 1%. You've only just learned one sub-variation, of one line, of a particular opening, and you have many more lines, with many more sub-variations to get through. Trying to develop a deep expertise and understanding of each section before moving on to the next, I would venture to say, becomes a prescription for failure for the majority of club players. My goal would be to first gain a good understanding of how to play the major lines of the Queen's Gambit, the Benoni, the King's Indian, the Slav, Semi-Slav, etc.; BEFORE going deep sea diving into each one. That's makes it much more digestible and also affords me a better chance of putting the main lines of my full repertoire into practice before I've learned everything there is to know playing well against the Benoni. Larry Kaufman, in his book, has one section for each major opening (e.g. Queen's Gambit, Queen's Gambit Accepted, Old Indian, etc.). He starts each section with an introduction into the his repertoire for how to handle each one. He explains the purposes for for specific moves, what the ideas are and a general plan going forward the main lines covered. He explains why certain paths are avoided and what the advantages are to the paths chosen. After the introduction, he will generally present 4-8 games, that allow us to explore different branches of that repertoire in digestible chunks. These games are typically no full games but take you to a substantial depth to best illustrate the ideas and plans being carried out in this particular line. On top of that you can purchase a version of the book for Ipad and Android that shows each move on a separate analysis board next to the text, so that you can easily to follow the moves in the book without having to have a chess set out. A chess engine is also included that will analyze any position, idea or variation while calculating at Grandmaster level and higher. Mr. Kaufman has also run every move of his recommended repertoire against the highest level chess engine, which eliminates errors that can appear in other Repertoire books. I find his repertoire to be very sound and detailed, but not overbearing. He also includes a number of solid theoretical novelties again, separating his work from many other's who's work is limited to known history. I highly recommend this book to all.</td><td>....it is far superior to the vast majority of other repertoire books, and that's before you even get to the content.</td><td>1.4358816E9</td><td>2015-07-03</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>503</td><td>2909</td><td>0.19097105508870216</td></tr><tr><td>67167779</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>AE53LEUY9ZK4X</td><td>B013C70KLQ</td><td>Kindle Customer</td><td>A very good read!</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>1.461888E9</td><td>2016-04-29</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>17</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>67167970</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A2M5ZO9UGT9LM3</td><td>B00KK5BR6Q</td><td>John Procter</td><td>This book had my attention right from the start.

Where did this information come from? Did the author make it up or is it from a reliable source? The book is poorly laid out. The flow of information didn't quite mesh with the topics. Some points are brought up several times, such as the sunshine issue being a good way to get Vitamin D. It was overkill. There is information in this book, but it could be inflated fluff without references. The author gives their take in every chapter, yet there is no reason to care about a non-medical person's (at least no md or PhDs behind the name) opinion. The book has information that should be taken with a grain of salt, talk to your doctor if you feel you are lacking in Vitamin D. It isn't a bad idea to get some sunshine or eating foods rich in Vitamin D to help up your natural Vitamin D stores, but before taking supplements, be sure your doctor is on board. In conclusion, this book did not answer my questions, it left me with more. Book was free on Amazon as a promotion. I am sorry to say that my honest review is it wouldn't be worth paying to purchase.

The book continues from the previous novel, Balance. Again, a well written novel with lots of steam in it and plenty of intrigue building at the end. While I enjoyed the book, I felt a little less steam and more build up to the promised intrigue would have served it better. That said, the author writes believable characters I care about. For this reader, Aiden comes off the page the best. He has a strong resolve and determination that are nicely balanced with his flaws. Not so much with the heroine. Also, even though this is a long series of books, I felt arguments were resolved a little too quick.

First of all, I bought it after having read the first novel in the series.  I am not sure I read the blurb.  In the first book in the series, Savannah and Garrick get together, but they start a long-distance relationship as she moves to Boston while he stays in Moncton.  So going into this book, I was basically rooting for Savannah and Garrick. Imagine my surprise when I realize that this novel is about Garrick falling in love with his teammate, Rhian.  It was not that I objected to the M/M aspect of the novel, but that the whole transition to their relationship seemed so contrived: Savannah tells Garrick he can take a male lover if he tells her about it.  Okay, maybe--but it's not particularly romantic as a premise.  And then for Garrick to take the risk *and* fall headlong in love so quickly-- basically, for the second time in a few months-- seemed frankly implausible. Now that said-- and somewhat counterintuitively--as the relationship between Garrick and Rhian developed, I came to really like them... both individually and as a couple.  So if I just tried to excise from my mind the fact that Savannah (and the first novel) ever existed, then I liked the novel a lot.  There was a tenderness between Garrick and Rhian that was really moving and is often missing from romances.  I also liked the way that the development of sexual intimacy went hand-in-hand with deepening emotional intimacy.  It was a smoking sexy and emotional love story. So if I hadn't read Fair Play first, and this had just been a novel about two hockey teammates who fall in love, and who deal with intimacy and with having to hide their relationship, then I would have said loved this book.  But as it was, I felt like the love triangle thing weakened it.</td><td>Sketchy premise, but good love story</td><td>1.485216E9</td><td>2017-01-24</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2016-11-30</td><td>55</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>329</td><td>1787</td><td>0.23434343434343438</td></tr><tr><td>67173814</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>AJRWVRSAICLK5</td><td>B00CKBOYG8</td><td>Princess M.

I especially appreciate the week-by-week instructions, showing what to watch out for and providing realistic alternatives to drinking.

The book goes beyond mere abstinence to help the reader deal with underlying issues that drive an individual to drink in the first place. It acknowledges the presence of social and cultural triggers and helps the reader increase awareness of outside influences as well as inner sources of temptation.

In this novel she brings forth a refreshing read that innocently starts out as one thing but quickly spirals into something dramatic and thrilling with a touch only of romance. It will also at times deceptively seem as such leaving you to think at times that it is that too but oh no. So love one that will keep you guessing. Bridget leaves one career to start another in order to honor her father who is killed on the line of duty. Just before doing so she meets Jeremy the night before this new move and it goes from there. He also turns out to be one of her new instructors in the training of new recruits. Forbidden territory also but can two that feel compelled to be with one another because of love being stronger stay away? Also there is someone out there targeting cops and it is escalating with no clues but they must be stopped. High paced drama to keep you wrapped up while this relationship builds. Friends are also made in this training that you get to know that they become like the three amigos. She will have you eating out of her hand so to speak when she will wring many a emotion from you with several high pitched drama events that will take place leaving you emotional spent with such a surprise that you will be using your shirt for tissue.

Any previous books I have read about Aliens were of different genres, so I wasn't sure what to expect when beginning Unplugged. However, the novel captured my interest and drew me in, and although I found it was different to other Alien books I have read, it intrigued and interested me just the same. It was well edited with no grammatical mistakes or spelling errors that I saw and I was impressed with the amount of research gone into this novel that was evident in Egbys writing. I liked that it encompassed both history and science, and in 'Unplugged' we were given an overview of half a million years of the worlds history in depth. Also, I liked that it made me think  I found myself wondering several times what life today would truly be like if the Anunnaki really existed, which shows that the plot was believable. The main character, David, was my favorite character, although they were all important and likeable, especially Rowan and Molly. Overall, my favorite part was the ending  everything tied up nicely and we were given all the answers we were wondering about throughout. On the whole, 'Unplugged' was an interesting read that was enjoyable because it was different from other books, and this is reflected in my rating of four stars. I would recommend this to a friend.</td><td>Interesting Read</td><td>1.4047776E9</td><td>2014-07-08</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>null</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>262</td><td>1487</td><td>0.2158854166666667</td></tr><tr><td>67177829</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A1SBCD95KWI93R</td><td>8854405620</td><td>ANONyMOUSE</td><td>I loved this book- so beautiful!

Naomi knows the law of her God requires fellow Israelites to protect and care for widows, orphans, and foreigners. Ruth, a Moabite, is taking quite a risk to travel with her mother-in-law to Bethlehem. Ruth gleans in Boaz's field, a man of standing and worthy character. He provides not only wheat for Ruth and Naomi to eat, but protection as well. As a widow and a foreigner Ruth is below the social status of Boazs servants, yet he shows her favor by giving her 10 times the amount of wheat as others and invites her to eat at his table. At the urging of Naomi, Ruth approaches Boaz as he sleeps and asks for a corner of his garment. A risky move but one evidently sanctioned by God as it leads to marriage for Ruth and Boaz. Inserts of contrasting text highlight information on Jewish traditions, vocabulary, and social customs concerning the Levirate Marriage and Guardian Redeemer.  Cross referencing scripture shows Gods providential care in the lineage of the Messiah.

Quinn, the companion was sent to be killed by his warlock sect of the world. Raph, vampire Prince has made it his quest to find the companion who spared his dying brother. And last but not least Desmond, the creator. He created Quinn for himself and then was denied him by the Warlock Console. Thus this is how our story begins.

That claim is, of course, not true, and this novel is the ultimate evidence to rebutt that argument. Masterton DOES understand women, and although they have a tendency to be sex objects in his novels and/or grinder meat, you cant say that they are one dimensional. This is hardly the first Masterton novel that features a woman protagonist (see \"The Chosen Child\" for example), but this is the first to portray the life of such a protagonist in a painfully agonizing and realistic light. There is no rainbow at the end of the rain here for our heroine Bonnie Winter; just a pile of mysteriously killed dead bodies and a supernatural (?) threat waiting in the wings. The novella has all that plus the usual plethora of gruesome violence one expects fron Masterton, although its mostly descriptions of the aftermath of these killings. But they still are repulsive enough to make a seasoned gorehound like me wince.

She goes to Germany with him.  He is handsome, serious-minded, methodical, insensitive in his love-making, interested in the art and architecture of the past;  she had studied at the Slade, was into post-impressionism and would become an artist in her own right.  She is not sure that she really loves him.  He is actually quite progressive, critical of the Wilhelmine establishment, and he has kept from his very upper-class family that he supports the Social Democrats. Thomas family give Irene a warm welcome, but one member already states that it is for her personally, but not for the English connection: there are circles in Germany who feel hostility towards her country.  Irenes brother Mark has become a close friend of Thomas brother Paul;  and Paul says they will be blood-brothers whatever happens between our countries. Irene was about to visit her family in England, but when war was imminent in 1914, she decided she had to stay with her husband.  Even the Anglophiles in her German family supported the German cause. Irenes brother Mark and her sister Sophia are also central to the novel.  Mark, a secret homosexual, is in the diplomatic service, first in Copenhagen and then in Washington.  Sophia works in France during the war as a nurse looking after German prisoners (one of whom, of course, will turn out to be a Curtius).  When she is on home leave, we get a good picture of the frenetic life the young people of both sexes are leading in view of the possibility that the young men on leave might not have long to live once they returned to the front. In 1916 Thomas is called up to do secret war work, and Irene feels very isolated, with most of her German relatives now rather cool towards her.  Her loyalties are now divided between her husband and her native country.  It is a dilemma, but she makes her choice.  Her betrayal would only come to light many years later, in 1930. When the war is over, Irene and her daughter come to England on a visit.  Before she left for England, she had buried in her garden the heirloom Prussian iron necklace which her mother-in-law had given to her.  Would she ever return to Thomas in Germany?  Of course its another dilemma for her - but, as in the case of the earlier one, I have no sympathy for her: I have found her throughout a character without any depth, and much less likeable than her basically decent husband.  But a painful surprise awaits us at the very end of the book about him also. In my opinion the novel has too many characters whose relationships to each other are not immediately clear.  A couple of chapters do not even name the characters appearing in them - we are supposed either to deduce who they are from what we have learnt before or to wait for enlightenment later on - an arch and tedious mannerism.  German phrases - on two occasions a dozen lines of dialogue - are untranslated.  The way the German historical background affects the characters is well done, though historical information is sometimes conveyed in didactic dialogue. The story is also interrupted (or disrupted, rather) by a few chapters which are set in the late 1960s, when Irenes daughter Dorothea shows her own daughter Pandora parts of an archive which has photographs from Irenes past, but she is reluctant to answer her daughters questions about them.  Pandora will do her own research for a book she wants to write about her grandmother (who had achieved some international renown as a painter), and she gradually finds some of the missing bits. The author clearly set out to write a family saga - not just a story  focussed on Irene and Thomas, Mark and Sophia, and on the problems arising out of an Anglo-German marriage during the period 1910 to 1933.  As the result there are sub-plots about other members of the family which are only loosely connected with the main story.  But as a family saga the book does not read smoothly:  it is uneven, unbalanced, (threre is much more about the Irenes side of the family than about Thomas) jerky as we move from one character to another and backwards and forwards from one decade to another), and with some loose ends (Pandoras father, for example, is never mentioned).</td><td>A family saga centred around an Anglo-German marriage, 1910 to 1950</td><td>1.4294016E9</td><td>2015-04-19</td><td>52</td><td>1</td><td>2015-03-22</td><td>28</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>777</td><td>4308</td><td>0.06668902526045382</td></tr><tr><td>67183256</td><td>1</td><td>false</td><td>A4CP99X059VQY</td><td>985081880</td><td>Kindle Customer</td><td>Too much back and forth hard to follow once you got a grip on one person the author flips you to another.</td><td>Too chaotic.</td><td>1.4846976E9</td><td>2017-01-18</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>2016-12-06</td><td>43</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>22</td><td>105</td><td>-0.14583333333333334</td></tr><tr><td>67183258</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>AN33UDYH3KNJB</td><td>098976737X</td><td>Charles M.</td><td>Pretty solid 4 stars.

Moreover, being that I'm also a 40-something fellow, like the main character, Dave, it really hit home with me there too. While I would not want to live Dave's life, I found reading about it to be hilarious at times and eerily familiar at others. Dave's friends alone (especially Mike, who is damn near *exactly* like a hockey buddy of mine) came across as so similar to the guys I hang out with that it was creepy! Mike's answer to his own question, \"HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DIE?\" made me laugh out loud, as did many things Mike said. The pacing in \"The Yoga Sutras\" is great and the character interactions are top-notch and believable. One of the great aspects of this story is how Radcliffe set-up a triangle of influences around Dave. The combination of \"Kali\" as the Yoga instructor, Dave's daughter Charlotte showing wisdom beyond her years while leading Dave to ask himself all sorts of interesting questions, and Marlene's, well, bitchiness...made for entertaining interactions across the board. If you're into Yoga, or you happen to be entering mid-life and the world is starting to pile up its seemingly endless \"joys\" on you, you'll find \"The Yoga Sutras\" to be a great read that will let you know that (compared to Dave) your life's really not that bad.</td><td>Great fun with many laugh-out-loud moments!</td><td>1.4049504E9</td><td>2014-07-10</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2014-06-04</td><td>36</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>1451</td><td>0.1745601173020528</td></tr><tr><td>67185698</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A1DC00T32U26HC</td><td>B00GTWXQD6</td><td>Kathy Q</td><td>Very interesting story line.

His betrayal as a normal dad, and her gradual realisation that her father was a monster, is something Skylark wants everyone to be privvy to, with the hope that this hidden scourge of men in society will be wiped out.

Emma is a book conservatory/historian who's set up a blog (she's a newbie to the idea) to discuss and translate a sixteenth century diary by someone named N.C. So the novella flip flops between Emma's blog and NC's diary. She was happy to have something to break up the monotony of inputting death registries for soldiers in the Middle Ages and her partner thinks the diary is a fake. Emma doesn't believe so. It's quickly obvious why he thought the diary was a joke because NC, the bastard son of a Viscount, is a soldier who's fallen for a gypsy woman and just as obviously she's a vampire and is likely to make NC one too. I have to say what happens in the modern day runs on some pretty predictable rails and the writing is a bit passive in places but still, it's entertaining enough and short. It does have an open end and there is a sequel.

It's seriously wheedled a special place in my affections. The plot is intriguing, the characters are well drawn and the writing style is enviably strong. Breakdown: The plot. I harboured suspicions of where the plot was headed, of which the main ones came through true. But the twist and turns leading to them, and the way in which it all played out proved an exhilarating ride of surprises. While the conclusion brings some major closure to the big questions so far, so many new ones are raised. In fact, the ending did have me cursing somewhat (I was warned that would be the case, and it was no lie), though definitely not in disappointment, rather frustration that I have to wait for the concluding part. I have theories of where book 3 might go and, whether they prove true to the mark or way out, I am so very much looking forward that journey of discovery. Characters. Although I've enjoyed many books, I do find it hard to form solid attachments to the female protagonists (I blame my innate bitchiness). Lyric, though, is such a perfect balance of independent bad-ass, misguided screw-up and loyal, sensitive sweetheart I absolutely adore her. She's not unbreakable but she's super determined and that's what gives her depth I can relate to. I enjoy the complexities of her relationships with others. Lyric really does not have an easy time of it with anyone in this second installment. Even her tight bond with Lincoln is shaken at its core. Her dad proves to be far from an endearing fellow. Her difficult relationship with Aiden, interspersed with utterly adorable tender moments, has me deeply involved (I so badly want good things for them). Gemma only gets more awesome in this book (given intriguing complexities all of her own) and I've also developed quite the soft spot for Trey. Writing. The dialogue is spot on -used well to forward the plot, define character and provide explanation in a way that feels natural. The book is well paced and balanced.

M. Stahl</td><td>This strange little compendium of self-published notions describing Benoit Mandelbrots conception of fractals was enjoyable to read and provided some information to a non-mathematician about the idea of fractals. There was some heavy reliance on formulas that require advanced mathematics to interpret. Those readers (like myself) have to skim over them and get to the principles that Mandelbrot had in mind. It is about bringing order to chaos. Most everything material in the world is in a state of constant flux and seemingly immeasurable. At least it cannot be formulated in traditional ways. Mandelbrot set to creating mathematical formulae that would organize fluctuation into comprehensible terms. And to that end create beautiful structures such as snowflakes. The authors used the over written and trite example how does one determine the length of the coast of Great Britain? I used to know how to do that without understanding fractals. You begin with a ball of string that is many thousands of miles long. Then you walk along the coast and unravel the string, securing it at different sequences and once you circumnavigate the land and return to your starting point you simply clip the string from its ball and roll it up into its own ball. You unravel that and measure its length. Voila! it would seem until someone questioned at which tide was the measurement taken? The concept of fractals was introduced in 1868 by Felix Hausdorff. It is from the Latin, fractus or break into irregular fragments. It was Mandelbrot who took the notion to its completeness prior to dying about 4 years ago. He spearheaded a movement to rearrange the idea of Chaos Theory popularized in the book Chaos by James Gleick, into Complexity Theory. Mandelbrot ordered the chaotic and turbulent material world into some order with his fractal geometry. This is done using non-Euclidean and non-linear geometry and no attempt will be made here to define those terms. That is left to a certain scientific faith that Mandelbrot was successful. His thinking has been used to the satisfaction of many in the mathematical and scientific world. Some time ago I had a zeal to discover in what worlds of science was complexity theory used. To determine this I used Google Scholar to send me results of papers published in peer reviewed journals. There were many. It seems that physicists studying flows were the predominant scientists using fractal technology and geometry. They studied atmospheric flow but most of the articles were about ground navigation such as traffic congestion and railroad patterns. The articles were all written in fairly obscure journals and the idea of complexity theory and fractals has heavily influenced the non-western scientists. It was adopted as a viable methodology almost exclusively in Asia. Fractals for all of the interesting things that can be done using that geometry, have not had a big impact on western practices yet (if ever). To this reader one lacking in most scientific and mathematical arenas, the beauty of fractals is unquestionable but the practicality of their use is up in the air. It reminds me of string theory in that in a formula it works elegantly but how it is used in the practical world is nebulous. I am in no way questioning its veracity since there is no skillset here to do that. I watch the observations, comments and uses in the sciences that I read about to see how new ideas are accepted and fractals have not mounted a significant case for their utility. They are fascinating though.</td><td>A beginner's journey into fractal math</td><td>1.4707008E9</td><td>2016-08-09</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2014-12-01</td><td>617</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>589</td><td>3536</td><td>0.23385730123535003</td></tr><tr><td>67194997</td><td>1</td><td>true</td><td>A2BAHTKW0OT7OS</td><td>9963999123</td><td>observer</td><td>I completely agree with another one star reviewer, this book is a complete disappointment.

We needed a box spring but the frame wasn't enough even support that. The box spring shattered, it was worthless. This frame replaced our old frame and box spring. It is just 1\" lower than our setup was before. Super sturdy and silent, there was some squeaking right after setting it up, but that went away as the bolts settled. Couldn't be happier. Also, because there is no box spring, we have tons of more usable space beneath the bed for storage. Highly recommended. If there is a con to this frame, it could be that there are multiple feet from the frame that go around the perimeter of the bed, giving you ample opportunities to kick and stub toes. However, long before this frame came around I found and have used the solution for that. Pool noodles. You can find them at most dollar stores. Cut them to the size of the leg and cut a slit in the back to slide it over the leg. Tape it on if it won't stay in place. The bed drape covers it so it doesn't look childish.

I fell in love with the characters and the world they live in.  This book was one that I took my time reading as I became immersed in the world of Mortisali.  Once there I did not want to leave. The characters were well defined and various important ones were introduced throughout the story.  The author did a great job developing each of them.  With the amount of important characters, it could have easily become confusing for the reader but since the author brought each character to life, it was very easy to distinguish each of them and which roles they played. I loved the uniqueness of this story.  The form of travel, the customs of Mortisali, the explanations as to why Cass had the experiences that she did, all brought great depth to this story. This is book 1 in a series and I am so excited to see where this story goes from here. There are so many possibilities, I cant wait to find out what awaits Cass as she moves forward down the path she has chosen.</td><td>Amazing!!</td><td>1.4599008E9</td><td>2016-04-06</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>2016-01-14</td><td>83</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>200</td><td>1072</td><td>0.3243992557150452</td></tr><tr><td>67201788</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>A35JOFX3DGREV0</td><td>1946220256</td><td>Barbara W</td><td>I love Chance, always have and now I love Hope.
