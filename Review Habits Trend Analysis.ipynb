And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.

Codemasters really hit a home run on this one. I would like to see F1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money.

I want to run this game with everything on highest level. I swear to you that even with the 460 + , the graphics are very realistic and I really enjoy racing at ground level. This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism. BUY THIS GAME !!!!! December 6, 2011  I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you. First of all anyone with this program, BUY the extra environments and cars. It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon. I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics. I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good, but not the standard of the ego 2 engine. Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has, the more adicted you will become. No other program running with all variables to the max, looks like Dirt 3.

I do have a high end video card but it doesn't make a difference.  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam.  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business (my favorite option).  I am very good with computers (built mine) so that is not the problem.

But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and final-kill cut-scenes that kill the game for me. I loath enforced QTE. When a mission goes awry and you're trying to escape a hail of bullets, if you happen to brush past an assailant you can't escape QTE mode. Meanwhile you're being shot at from all sides. It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had, and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second-rate interactive movie. As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise, I waited years for this. I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc. What they did add took away from the game. For instance they should have kept the semi-open-worlds of Blood Money and build-on those beautiful sets, maps and locations. I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim. Overall Dishonored's gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience. But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinite's breathtaking visuals in that particular game. ================================================================== Wow after all these years waiting-- this is it.....?!!! I am still a huge fan of Blood Money. The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus! To play, all you have to do is watch a 30-second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level. Who can complain about that? But this, what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid?! Intuition....? STOP! STOP! STOP Please let me use my own intuition! And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you're an idiot? All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere, tension and suspense! You want to know how bad this game is....? They use cut scenes for the final kill, thus killing any sense of pay off! And you can't even skip through the intro level! Hello? This was a cult game... So lots of people know how to play it and don't need this hand holding to be mandatory! The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money, and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games. There is less of a non-linear feel about this version also. Now you're not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels, but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO. Such a shame, such a shame. But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design. It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the table.</td><td>Skip!</td><td>1357776000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>12 26, 2012</td><td>A2GPRA9HHLOC4B</td><td>0700026398</td><td>Wicasawakan</td><td>I will open with the Pros: Replayability - It's Hitman. What did you expect? You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner, quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did. Length of game - Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game. I finished it in one weekend. Friday night, Sat and Sunday. I would estimate around 10-12 hours solid play. BUT..If you go back and replay the missions for a better score, then it can drag out much further. But like I said, to play through and complete the tasks, it is not a long game. Story - Not bad at all. A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad. Overall Graphics - Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes. Don't confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay. Character dev - Although they give you a little info on specific targets, it didn't seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story. I just went forth on a killing spree. You point me in that direction? Here I go. There's no option to ever take a person into custody and question them. You kill anyone who you are pointed at. Hand to hand - They kept it simple. between space bar, \"Q, W or E\" were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key. It wasn't hard to do hand to hand. It wasn't 100% awesome like Batman but it was pretty good. Cons: OMG why did all the people in close-up cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing? It really got annoying. I have never in my life met a person who talks like that. Also, the timing of the voice acting was bad. Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again. So, voice acting wasn't bad, but developers did a poor job clipping it. Graphics - In regards to clipping, I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps. I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass. Also, it would say there was a key point right in front of me (blinking sonar circles) and there was nothing there. No desk, nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air. More developer issues. (Minor Spoiler) Don't read if you can't take hints. Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down. I couldn't believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals. Professional Edition: Do not waste your money. I got some weapons you can't even use in the game. It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game. No point in having access to the additional weapons. Sniper challenge is ONE challenge. I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge. It just lets you do the same challenge over and over. All in all, it's a good game discounted at 1/2 price or lower.

Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security. CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play.  Annoying interface.  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do.  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  Setting up a race takes way too long.  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back).  Takes too long to unlock things.  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.  Video stuttering (possibly my equipment). PROS - Eye candy.  Plenty of game modes.  Enough tracks to get going.  Fairly good variety of cars.  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced. I think this franchise, like many others, continues soley for the purpose of farming user information; where it seems the real money is.  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.  Sometimes it might be worth it, but not here.  I found some entertainment value, but very briefly.

Lew</td><td>I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.</td><td>Dirt, Dirt 2, and Dirt 3</td><td>1354752000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2012</td><td>AQTC623NCESZW</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Chesty Puller</td><td>I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is.

I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.

But overall, if you don't mind playing with the same default cars all the time, it's a pretty fun game. I really only play online mode, which allows you to race against other people.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!</td><td>An overlooked gem in the Forza/GT treasure trove</td><td>1332115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>10 19, 2011</td><td>ANW6EGY12V5XS</td><td>0700099867</td><td>Henri Savin</td><td>I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with. I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off. As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me. Pros: - Amazing graphics - Amazing physics - Challenging but entertaining races Cons: - Gymkhana - Interface What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck. I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating. Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss. Conclusion: As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today. If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!

Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it. Why they can't get their asses in gear (pun intended) and fix it I don't know, but with so many folks reporting the problem it isn't just occasional. I assume they either can't replicate the problem or just don't care. Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim.</td><td>Abysmal support from Codemasters</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>3.0</td><td>7</td><td>true</td><td>09 14, 2011</td><td>A1DLMTOTHQ4AST</td><td>0700099867</td><td>ampgreen</td><td>I got this version instead of the PS3 version, which turned out to be a mistake. Console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their PC versions, but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows. First off the installation takes about 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. I have never had a game take this long to load, Shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also. Next many of the latest games for PC are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game, regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games. Shift 2 unleashed is also like this, so be forewarned. Internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes. The game pushes you, but does not require you to, sign up for a Games For Windows Live account, which is required to get the game patches and updates. More time wasted signing up for that. Finally after about one hour the game was up and running , but the menu screen text had red blocky borders, and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red, with red reflections on the car and everywhere. So more time spent googling to find a solution to this. I had to download a hot-fix driver update for my AMD videocard driver, which solved that red text and sun problem. Finally after nearly 2 hours I was able to play the game, which is perhaps the prettiest racing game I have ever played. Magnificent graphics, and fun excellent gameplay. Good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel, and excellent sense of speed and immersion, makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to it. I was really, finally enjoying the game , when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed. No error message or anything, it just hung up and crashed to desktop, under windows 7. I later tried it with Windows XP on the same machine, and it crashed less frequently, usually only when exiting the game, but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game, since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lap. It is a great game when it works, and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game. But hang on to your receipt just in case. I am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game, so I think I am going to buy a copy for my PS3, which has never crashed, in over 3 years of game playing. I have been buying the top notch PC versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu's , but I have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software, and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number, utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space, 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install Windows 7 ) , and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store, and still you have to put that stupid little DVD in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax. I am pretty much done with PC gaming, since the consoles are so much less hassle, and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it. When the PS4 and Xbox 720 come out, I think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident.</td><td>awesome game, if it did not crash frequently !!</td><td>1315958400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>02 23, 2017</td><td>AQQQ3IA92VBGR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Steven Rea</td><td>The metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it.

Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable, but also the pages are printed on 80lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases.  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date.  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number 49647 of 50000.  When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted.  They have also released a collector's guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well.  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collector's items.  Here's hoping they also release books for Majora's Mask when it inevitably releases on the 3DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring 2015, whenever it is ready.</td><td>Excellent reference material for the latest Zelda games</td><td>1390176000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>83</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>01 15, 2014</td><td>A3Q1EK4VBVHJCP</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Natalia Canela</td><td>amazing cool awesome interesting guides of the legend of Zelda excellent collectors edition item great for Zelda fans super cool</td><td>Great</td><td>1389744000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>01 15, 2014</td><td>A2DFT8S9UHSETY</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Christina</td><td>I already have all the Zelda Collectors edition guides but I decided to purchase this as well just to add to my collection.

The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games. My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately. I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.</td><td>So awesome, but why no guide for A Link Between Worlds?</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>11 29, 2013</td><td>A2AL1GN0TMTUXR</td><td>0804161380</td><td>ROB F.</td><td>this is a great price on this set, the treasure chest is a great addiiton. they are limited to 50k so buy it up!</td><td>LOZ is the best!</td><td>1385683200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>true</td><td>11 27, 2013</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.</td><td>A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans</td><td>1385510400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>4.0</td><td>55</td><td>true</td><td>11 27, 2013</td><td>A10PPCIFVK9ZT5</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Gary Coffman</td><td>I have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and pre-ordered it back in August. I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides, but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and, over time, they became very expensive. This works out great because we can get all of the Collector's Edition guides, plus one never released and only available in this set (Ocarina of Time) for a great price - each guide ends up being less than $20 each not including the packaging. As other have said, the packaging is wonderful. The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold, metal etched bookmark is gorgeous! The actual shipping packaging was great, as well - very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape. The guides themselves are gorgeous! Great detail and amazing artwork. I also love how the paper edges are golden - it gives it a very classy look. I have yet to actually read through them, let alone use them, so I can't say how accurate and useful they are, but I am sure the do their job and then some. I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible. Fortunately, however, I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides, so that was a huge sigh of relief. I do have a few gripes for this set, though. They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things, so it didn't kill it for me too much - they are just things I wish they would have included. First, I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games, i.e. Zelda I and II for NES, Link to the Past for SNES, LInk's Awakening for Gameboy, etc. I wouldn't even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient - it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set. Second, I was disappointed they didn't leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds. They've had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this, as well as the collector's edition guide. Not a huge deal, but again... would have been a nice consideration. Third (and this is just something I would have thought to be cool - not dinging this set at all for not doing it) it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it - similar to when you open a greeting card with pre-recorded messages. Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself - until then I will have to just sing the tune myself :) Finally, I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released weren't included. I will be honest, I don't know which guides came with what, but I have seen others complain about this, stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies. Overall, I am very happy with this set. For Zelda fans, it is a must buy especially if you don't own many or any of these guides already.

Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have \"harmony\" (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active.  However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part.  Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead.  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do.  lol  It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics.

The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged. Before you buy this part, look up some youtube videos on how to replace it, and decide if you're comfortable doing this.. It took me about an hour or two, to cautiously tear apart, and replace it. You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing. It's nothing overly complicated, but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the \"bottom\" of the device. The screen i received had black trim on the front, which matched my black gamepad. Your mileage may vary on the color since it didn't specify in the item listing. In the end, I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a new/used/refurb gamepad for $150-$180. If done properly, no one will ever know you opened the gamepad.

This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game). If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time. You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game. It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then. I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all. If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2. These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running.</td><td>This is not as bad as others have said...</td><td>1329868800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>154</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 5, 2011</td><td>A3BHSG5R5NGKWK</td><td>8176503290</td><td>T.

In analog mode, the D-pad is mapped to buttons 13-16 instead of a hat switch as you might expect. This can mean extra configuration for some games, but it does allow it to register simultaneous presses of opposite directions (eg. left+right), which has always been one of the odd things about PlayStation controllers. In digital mode, the left stick reads as centered but the Z and Z Rotation axes (right stick) are either all the way up or down, which can cause some trouble. The N64 side doesn't work at all for me. I tried it with both an OEM Nintendo controller and an InterAct MakoPad 64 (both tested and work perfectly with a real N64). With both of them, all buttons and axes (even the ones N64 controllers don't have, like the right stick) constantly press and unpress on their own. Note that there is a switch on the left side of the unit that switches between N64 and PlayStation modes. Away from you is PlayStation (left/red LED), towards you is N64 (right/green LED). I say this because there are no instructions and the switch is completely unlabeled.</td><td>OK for PS/PS2, useless for N64</td><td>1313107200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>160</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>true</td><td>07 10, 2010</td><td>AHO7BK8TE581B</td><td>8565000168</td><td>pzkfw</td><td>I was interested in this product for the n64 part.  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N64. Trying to get a PS2 controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS2 copy of their controller that goes through native USB. I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP3 32 bit and GNU/Linux Kernel 2.6+, same results. PS1 Controller: (Both official Sony controllers) Dualshock (Analog sticks): Worked, but the back L and R buttons (L2 and R2) would not trigger.  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly. Original (No Analog sticks): Worked perfect.  Back L and R buttons work. PS2 MadCatz Controller: Didn't work at all.  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller. Had no authentic ps2 controllers to test. N64: I had two controllers to test with it. Transparent purple:  Every button worked, but the analog stick would not go %100.  Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it %100.  Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly. Gray:  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly. Maybe I got a bad one, but I really think this thing sucks.

I have seen many ships, sailed with him around the world numerous times. So ships are in my blood. When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid. Well I wish I didn't because I now regret my decision. The game is unique in its concept. We never really had a maritime ship simulation that wasn't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships :). This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo, to passenger, to rescues, to towing, to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc. The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations. Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game. But to me thats where all the goodies end. The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game. Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series. First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary \"Time Compression\" feature. Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun. Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission. With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast. This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me. I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot don't too. Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more. If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers. Second is the still dated graphics engine. I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look. I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise. The ships and ocean etc. looks very simplistically rendered from today's standard. The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though. Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion. This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts, hover boats etc. I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats. Anyways..i wouldn't really recommend anyone spend $40 bucks on this game. Wait until it gets to $19 or so bargain bin. And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me.</td><td>Great concept but equally flawed game....</td><td>1218585600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>168</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>true</td><td>04 17, 2008</td><td>A3NIF89RBTYXZP</td><td>907843905X</td><td>The Plague Doctor</td><td>This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it.

My controller skin arrived today, well ahead of expected delivery, just as described solid black and silicone. Fit is just perfect, and installation had no problems. Good comfortable smooth texture, while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic. I like to clean my game equipent regularly, and I always clean even new items before using. This is a great way to test the quality of the item, I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol, no gumming (like you get with lower grade skins)and no color bleed onto the rag, this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff. Once on the controller grip is good, comfort is good, feel is natural. I am very pleased with this controller skin, I have been needing to get one for my extra controller.

Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller. Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart.

Ever since the Playstation and beyond, companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing. This memory card is no exception to that rule. I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet. (This is not to imply that it will last forever, you should always make backups just in case) Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on 1 memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing 8-meg memory card. Being able to hold 16x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable. Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a... well... not so much a problem as it's more of an annoyance. (One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will \"READ\" your card first before it will \"WRITE\" to the card to save. This can take as much as 2-3 minutes before it will finally do anything, and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES.) Other than that, the card works on just about every game I have played (Numbering 150+ games on my PS2) Overall, all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over 1 year now. Of course, like any electronic device, experiences will vary from person to person.

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times. The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was \"Stuntman Ignition\" (possibly \"Stuntman\" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.  The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time. So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.</td><td>Hardly Functions</td><td>1338422400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>310</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>03 5, 2012</td><td>A1GLFVY2JJNCIK</td><td>9629971372</td><td>THE_RED</td><td>Lo recib hace cuatro das y estoy super contento, funciona excelente, tanto la consola como la tarjeta de memoria.

One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear.

All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack. I'd recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV.  Their \"may\" be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games, but I couldn't beat the price.  I didn't bother even looking for an alternative.</td><td>Works great to extend gamecube controller cord</td><td>1364860800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>363</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>02 9, 2013</td><td>A33RQCUQW7DS8N</td><td>9882155456</td><td>AntMont</td><td>These things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head.

The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game. Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked. Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games.

Everyone went crazy for  it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay,  and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though,  terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness. But Myst was in 1993  -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is  amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology. So how well can \"Riven: The Sequel To Myst\" hold up  against \"current technology\" and the original classic? By simply  making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more  \"spookiness\" -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the  game. \"Riven\" is even more rewarding than \"Myst\" so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the  game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it  starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to  another in less than 20 minutes. The graphics, while nice, aren't the  best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is  sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it.

It was when I first got my PS and I wasn't disappointed. The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman, Iron Man, The Hulk, Psylocke, Wolverine and others.  For those who played Marvel vs. Capcom 2 before this one, the movement may feel a little slow to you.  However, this was the first of the Marvel vs. Capcom style games so don't expect it to be as good as MVC2. The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles.  You'll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly.  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them. On this game you'll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC2.  However, since this was the first of these type of fighter games, the characters have less moves to execute.  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems.  There are 6 Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters.  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem, he turns silver and gains super armor.  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates 3 copies of herself so then it's like fighting 3 of them at once.  The final boss on this game is Thanos.  He's better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because he's actually a challenge.  He automatically starts the match with all 6 gems and he also has 6 different hyper combos he can do with each gem.  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs. Street Fighter. I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price.  You won't be disappointed.  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC2 before playing this but it's still enjoyable.</td><td>One of the best 2D fighters on the original Playstation</td><td>1080691200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>411</td><td>4.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>02 6, 2003</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVF</td><td>Zachary</td><td>Don't you remember the times about 7 or so years ago before the vs. games like X-Men Vs. Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter were out, when you were at your local mall's arcade room, and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play, you kept winning and no one could beat you, you had a blast and you ruled the arcade, you used the Amazing Spider-Man, or Good Ol' Stars and Stripes himself, Captain America, and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players, and you used the Infamouse Yellow, Blue, Green, and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed, Strength, Power, Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character! Well I do, and I was so stoked when it came out, and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom! Gameplay: Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns, barely noticeable, and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version. Sound: Perfect, unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters, and music is still here(and still rules)with no remixes(Thank God)! Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade! Graphics: Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSX(like that was a problem for this game in the 1st place), and they were done with POLYGONS, yes, POLYGONS! Characters: You get a line up of the following characters: 1. Spider-Man (My favorite! \"Maximum Spider!\") 2. Captain America (\"Justice Will Prevail\") 3. The Incredible Hulk (What's to say, he's a \"Monster\" hahahahahaha...sorry.) 4. Magneto (He rules and can pull off great combos!) 5. Wolverine (The cheap one) 6. Juggernaut (He's huge and probably deals more damage than anyone!) 7. Iron Man (With the Infamouse \"Proton Cannon!\") 8. Blackheart (A good and Cheep caharacter, but not as much as Wolvie.) 9. Psylocke (One of my favorite X-men, and overall choice over Wolvie, to bad Gambit wasn't included.) 10. Shuma-Gorath (Not used by me, but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game.) Over-All: If I could, a 9.3/10.0, but I can't, so 4 out of 5, the reason being, could have been one point better if it weren't for the PSX limitations, but man, that definetly didn't stop me from getting it AT ALL!

The game itself has six-degrees of freedom so you can shoot upside-down, sideways, etc. The single-player has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting. I never actually figured out how to save the game, but I will figure it out eventually. The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends. The game supports 4-player multiplayer, even thought sadly I've only played it with only one other person. The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big. One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so it's like there are 3 other people in the room with you.

However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way. Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well. The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons. As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isn't as good but if you don't have a psx its still playable plus a sequel.

This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games. It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind. I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart. Graphics- 7/10 The transition to 3-D for Megaman isn't an ugly one, but a decent one. Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky. Still, you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all. Not to mention, there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game. Story- 10/10 You are Megaman Volnutt. Roll Casket and her Grandpa, Barrel Casket, have raised you since they found you when you were a child. Following Barrel's footsteps, Megaman and Roll become Diggers. Diggers are people who search through ruins, infested with Reaverbots, to find parts and other things. The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors, which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society. The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around. Megaman, Roll, and Barrel crash-land their flying ship, The Flutter, on an island called Kattelox. You go on to discover the island's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates. Sound- 7/10 The music and sound effects in this game are decent. Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death. Some tunes even become catchy, like the Apple Market tune. Gameplay- 10/10 You play as Megaman: exploring ruins, fighting pirates, and just helping people out. There are a lot of side quests you can do. You can join a secret gang, fill a museum with underground arts, help a little girl recover, play in game shows, and so much more. The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island's great treasure, or disaster. While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with. It's not just in the Sub-Gates either; you can search in other digging sites for parts. You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun, which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially. These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun's shooting. You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well. You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability. Difficulty- 4/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty) Since this game is more story based, the difficulty is slight. There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die, minus a few bosses. Once you beat the original game, you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option. The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble. Also, to top it off, the game isn't that long. Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours. That includes the main storyline and all side quests, minus special weapon upgrading. I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours. Overall- 10/10 Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound, it's still 5 stars. The game's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesn't even matter. You'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again.</td><td>My Favorite Game or All Time</td><td>1209859200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>432</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 11, 2007</td><td>A2GW1DBM406VU1</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Jarrett P.

Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert. I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon.

Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless.

So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.</td><td>Mega Man in 3D</td><td>1153094400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>436</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>06 9, 2005</td><td>AMZCQIDUWDHLC</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>John. N</td><td>To me, Mega Man Legends is one of those games you'll remember years after playing it. The game itself doesn't break any new ground and has its share of flaws, but the overall experience is definitely rewarding. Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the control scheme, such as a lock on system that doesn't allow you to move while locked on an enemy (which was fixed in MML2), and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark. Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well, complete with all the flat, 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming. Unlike Tomb Raider, the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful, adding to the games cartoon-like feel, rather than the dark, dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids. The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well. Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience, this isn't an error so to speak, but older, more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours (especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing). Thankfully, Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge (oh and is it ever a challenge). Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches, and all can be forgiven here. So with all these problems, why is Legends such a good game? Heart, and lots of it. Mix in a good story, a wonderful cast of characters (and enemies), and throw in some of Capcom's more respectable forays in voice acting department, and you got a winner. While some may claim that Legends carries a \"kiddy tone\", I actually find this to be one of the game's charms and strengths. Honestly, if you don't laugh when one of the Lego Men, err, I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron, there is something wrong. Seriously, it isn't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game (or most of Nintendo's gaming library for that matter). The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead. While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 (considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2's ending), at least Capcom didn't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it's fun and respectability, of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series. In the end, Mega Man Legends is not a game you'll remember for amazing graphics, razor-sharp control, or challenging quests. Instead, you'll walk away with a overall memorable experience.</td><td>A good game with lots of heart...</td><td>1118275200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>437</td><td>4.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>11 28, 2000</td><td>A2329GPAT2XIIZ</td><td>B000006P0M</td><td>Ultimate Reviewer</td><td>For the \"Ace combat\" initiated, this game is a lot better that the original \"Ace Combat\" for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed \"Ace Combat\" too, in the beginning.

And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2... If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission. I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed. The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear \"Bingo!\" every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself. In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game.

Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems.  Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements.  Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail.  although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1.  And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system.  Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay.  You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground.  Which was improved in later Tekkens.  And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times.  The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken.  Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss. And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves.  I don't remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process.  Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic.  Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends.  Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?).  This is a personal favorite of mines.  But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy.

Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.

Jongeling</td><td>While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started. On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course. Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995. The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some. Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more.

Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears. Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past. Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing. However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat. With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play.

He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know  he's a dragon.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.</td><td>Of dragons and boredom</td><td>965692800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>454</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 28, 2000</td><td>A2OVX97R347HXC</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game. As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation. As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw. As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it. The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do. And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental. If you get this game buy it. Overall this game is the worst of  the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some  collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow  people around.</td><td>Just didn't meet my expectations.</td><td>964742400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>455</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>05 27, 2016</td><td>A2GM5B6DK9KP22</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Junkhog</td><td>Perfect</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1464307200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>456</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 23, 2015</td><td>A119Q9NFGVOEJZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Ivan Orozco</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's the best of the best capcom rocks all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the games that capcom made from the 80s to 2015 rocks breath of fire 5 is the greatest video game company in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 5 rocks,breath of fire 6 is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire 6 rocks</td><td>capcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius's</td><td>1437609600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>457</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>06 14, 2014</td><td>A14IQPHOQ9LAYH</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Adam Hatton</td><td>haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright</td><td>awesome</td><td>1402704000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>458</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>02 1, 2014</td><td>A1296CMAKC79FZ</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Andrea W</td><td>Item arrived on time and as described.

Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear. Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.</td><td>It keeps getting better</td><td>1065225600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>464</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>06 17, 2002</td><td>AACIKO4GH062J</td><td>B000006OVE</td><td>Eric C.

I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation.  Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear.  It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay.  And what gameplay!  It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit.  Last, I must mention the fishing system.  It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable.  Nothing else could more easily describe it.  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own!  It's that good.  For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance.

To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.

The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners.

The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible.  The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master.  The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story.  It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose.  Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing.  Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives.  If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.</td><td>Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game</td><td>982886400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>472</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>05 27, 2001</td><td>A32GARQ84MVVYV</td><td>B000006P0K</td><td>Taylor Moore</td><td>Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter, Tekken, this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for.

It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about. Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games. For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes. The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling). Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME.

What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.</td><td>Butchered arcade to home conversion</td><td>1107129600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>497</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>11 20, 2003</td><td>A2GAP7XWBZU8QI</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Eric</td><td>I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB.  If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.  I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you won't be disappointed.</td><td>What was Capcom thinking?</td><td>1069286400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>498</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>08 13, 2003</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game. One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay. The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade. This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.</td><td>This game is bad</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>499</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 3, 2003</td><td>A2CKNSDDC5XOFG</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be.

I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX \"greatest hits\" and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.</td><td>Concept is good, but tedious game play really spoils the fun</td><td>999043200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>504</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 24, 2001</td><td>AK00PWOR3BNAQ</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>MacArthur Davis</td><td>Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters!!

This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series, though I'm not excatly sure why. I think the main reasons it feels so different are: the graphics, the story line, the music, and the character differnces. Graphicaly wise, you can tell it's older, but the graphics have a certain charm to them. The few out-of-engine motion scenes though, are magnificent! However, the graphic style is drasticaly different from it's sequels. The plot is overall, a little more \"classic fantasyish\" and feels kinda like something you might read in a book (which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a \"book theme\"). It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it; which makes it feel slightly more intense than it's sequals. Actually, I think it's the best story of any of the Klonoa games. As for the ending, I loved it! Sad and moving without being overly sad. I think it's my favorite vidoe game ending! The BGM is a different style than Lunatea's Veil also, (It's PS2 sequal) less solemn and RPG like, and a little more lively, or something, not really sure what the word is, it fits the game well. What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow. Klonoa, however, is quite different than in his sequels. Dispite these differences, the gameplay is practicaly clone-copy of the others in the series, esspecial Lunatea's Veil. From what I have heard, many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel. I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didn't give it much of a chance (personaly, I was dissapointed with THIS game at first, then started to really like it after I got used to it). Anyway, bottom line is, that if you've played all the other Klonoa games, expect this one to be a little different, but defenently get it, if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this! If you haven't played any of the other games in this great series, it's based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls. This game is one of the few \"2.5D\" games in existance. It plays parellel to a 2D game (people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or Mario Bros. should try this). In this game, however, you are in a 3D environment (don't worry, the paths are clearly defined, you won't have any trouble figuring out where you can and can't go). You can interact with the background by throwing things into it, this is esspecially key in some bosses, This is the 2.5D part. There are 12 levels (not counting the final boss)in this game, plus an unlockable time attack level. This game is pretty easy, and if your looking for an extreamly hard, nail biting, challenge, this probably isn't for you. This is more of a fun, relaxing game.

It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste. Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills. Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle. The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save. This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed. For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.</td><td>Begin The Treasure Hunt!</td><td>1391558400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>522</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 24, 2013</td><td>A4Z9NHOW5LT0M</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>JoB</td><td>Tomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was. The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore. I haven't played the original since it first came out so I didn't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game. They took a lot. Some of the level designs are almost identical. The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty. Anniversary is way easier. But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier. It's because of the controls. Back in Tomb Raider 1, the controls were pretty terrible. But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D? So I'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5.</td><td>Still great</td><td>1187568000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>530</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>11 16, 2004</td><td>A33693RRRFK55Q</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>B. Erickson</td><td>OH YES....this game is what it's all about.  Sure, it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D (cf. Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES.  \"Tomb Raider\" was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with.  Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol.  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform.  Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut.  The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all. Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture.  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy.  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants.  All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something. It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride.  Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills.  There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden \"secrets,\" which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous \"medi-paks.\" Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after.  They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.</td><td>The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff</td><td>1100563200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>531</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 1, 2004</td><td>A1FD8LITJZE48V</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Frank Ponce</td><td>Ok, sounds perveted. It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy, adventurous, and alluring Lara Croft, but many other people do too. Anyway, this is it. The first \"Tomb Raider\" game. It has classic written all over it. Despite being dated, and encountering countless predecessors, sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all. It was orginal back then, where archaeologist Lara Croft, a female Indiana Jones, is called upon to use her intelligence, amazing physical skills, and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles, battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style. I forget the storyline, since I haven't played this game in ages, but it's good. You should ask my mom, who played and beat every \"Tomb Raider\" game(Sorry mom). I'm not kidding! She did! The graphics are surprisingly good to look at, as well as the hard puzzles to solve(which made it famous to play) and the fun movie scenes. Check out the dinosaur too in this game. it's a blast!

Convery</td><td>If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have.  I played this originally when it first came out in 1996.  Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games.  I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that. Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment.  Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis.  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels.  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around.  Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here.  Nothing short of ingenious. The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done.  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing.  Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch.  Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick \"about-face\".  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing.  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2.  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe).  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well. There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after.  For example, \"The God Room\" of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played. So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date?  For a few reasons.  First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months.  Every six months I go back to it.  The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability.  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review \"Dear Eidos\") is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box.  At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems.  I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance.  I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever.  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that.  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week.  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day.  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it.  Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box.  There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.

In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase \"girl power\", there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No. 1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time. The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end. The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now! OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...</td><td>Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!</td><td>1031011200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>534</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 25, 2002</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>It's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway.

Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it. The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect. I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.</td><td>An Outstanding Game Certainly to Become a Classic</td><td>1023580800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>536</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>03 15, 2002</td><td>A2JVBNO9A6JAVV</td><td>B000006RGS</td><td>C-N-G</td><td>Like I've said before, Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time.

Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him. How untrealistic is that?

Jongeling</td><td>Fighting Force was the wanna-be \"Streets Of Rage\" for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game. There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile. The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face. You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it. All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time.

Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot. You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing \"Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo\" Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world. Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version. The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon. If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz.

From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy.  It is ingenius.  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really \"snazzy\" throws/blocks.  Like people have said, it is like a \"Streets of Rage\" for the now.  Let me break it down overall for you:   Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar.  Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none!  5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.   Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch!  5/5   Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family.  The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience.  Thank God for infinite health codes!  3/5 (ouch)   Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up.

In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds. Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for? I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.</td><td>The Best Game in an Outstanding Series</td><td>1024444800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 1, 2016</td><td>AX8NRG579WOCV</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>N. Soucy</td><td>This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.  When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed. I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically. The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game. So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.  It's a blast, and I actually finished that game.</td><td>Too clunky for a modern gamer</td><td>1480550400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>555</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 13, 2016</td><td>AH5OGQP0S9KSU</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Alan C.

It had vast improvements over the first.  From using flares to light up rooms, to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun.  Also Lara's moves are improved.  The back flip and doing a 180 in the air combo was one of the best. The game was a lot more challenging than the original.  The first one you only fought a total of 4 different characters with guns.  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns.  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original.  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end, and get every secret without any hints.  One of my top favorite five video games of all time.

These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual \"Tomb Raiding\" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game.

You'll never feel such joy until you play this. It's definitely different than the first. In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them. Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs. The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers. There are also Doberman's, sharks, eels, tigers, vultures, rats and spiders. Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands, you'll see... You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols, harpoon gun, uzis, shotgun and M16. You can drive motorboats, ski mobiles. there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads, doors that you are approaching (which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out) Or simply break away floor boards. If there is one hint I can give you is that *Always* draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway. You'll be glad you did. This game is still full of an lot of things, and quite frankly it still freaks me out to play.

I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. \"The Wall\" It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc \"old and scratched up\" quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.</td><td>Tomb Raider II</td><td>1275436800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>570</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>03 11, 2009</td><td>A2J55HYXQYGZXB</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>J.

The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different.  The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game.  But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased.  In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series.  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times.  This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide.  You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room.  Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on.  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches.  Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian.  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring.  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game.  Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons.  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory.  Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon.  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it.  If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind.  If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.</td><td>Still holds up</td><td>1045526400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>574</td><td>5.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>09 26, 2002</td><td>A3HTX1NOTTWERP</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Busy Body</td><td>Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got! After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian. OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...</td><td>The Best PlayStation Game Of All Time!</td><td>1032998400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>575</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>07 24, 2002</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B000006RGR</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>This game is great to get into and back again never mind.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).</td><td>I need this and the second one</td><td>1150502400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>580</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>12 28, 2003</td><td>A155BURC4779CK</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Zachary</td><td>The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos. Lets go over it: 1st - classic with no supers lots of characters 2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters 3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.</td><td>One thing people are missing to consider about this game!</td><td>1072569600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>581</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>08 13, 2003</td><td>AQMWZIH22R6LE</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>TwistaG</td><td>The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name \"Street Fighter II\" is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's \"handcuffs\" and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a \"collection\" that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley. But fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting.</td><td>Good but not great</td><td>1060732800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>582</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>04 11, 2001</td><td>A1LEN6BO4XR1DI</td><td>B000006OVI</td><td>Sean Shannon</td><td>Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze.  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master.  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one. Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring.  Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II.  Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games.  The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block. The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection.  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation.  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging. Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value.  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.</td><td>Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired</td><td>986947200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>583</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 12, 2004</td><td>A1JHJ48J9EZNMH</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Robert evans</td><td>This wwf game sucks...

When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like. War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers. The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game. Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches. Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again. Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead</td><td>Boring Game!</td><td>1400716800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>586</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>12 20, 2012</td><td>A3TQTYD0D6AUO3</td><td>B000007NJC</td><td>Steve F</td><td>Use to play this as a kid and when I played it, it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.</td><td>the absolute low point</td><td>1152748800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>588</td><td>4.0</td><td>15</td><td>false</td><td>09 9, 2000</td><td>AAQ75C4BJUQLO</td><td>B000009QCX</td><td>Sixto Limiac</td><td>Kartia: \"The Word Of Fate\" (recognized as Rebus in Japan), crams  fabulous innovation in one decent Strategy/RPG. Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console, Atlus begins to grow as a  company who'll soon promote their selves into a house-hold name. Like the  arising empire of Enix. Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game, Eggs of Steel, Atlus is gaining momentum with their  not-notch RPGs.  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious- Final Fantasy Tactics-, Kartia packs  charming  innovations. Sure, Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT,  or any archers for the matter, yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden. It has Phantoms. Once the player ons his PlayStation, the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma. Each  character has a totally different story process.  The niddy-griddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms. They are  paper-rock-scissors monsters.  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa.  Phantoms play the most basic role.  During the game,  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons.  Assembling the player's own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death. The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFT's system. From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character,  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any Strategy/RPG game.  What really  amazes, is the addition to disturb the environment. Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking.  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting, but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear. Gladly, there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well, the 2P Mode. Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the 2P Mode. Kartia takes  Strategy/RPGs deeper. The 2P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data. Players can also trade items.  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end.  Kartia is an engrossing story. With  a tale like this, why not bring an anime in the movie industry?  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions. Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much. Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight. It's up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels. Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring,  but once the backstabs roll in, there's no way the player can let the  controller free again. Someone, anyone, make Kartia an anime!  Graphically Kartia is a 3D splendor. The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment. When a person speaks, a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the character's faces appear. At the FMV department, the videos are  dark, and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eye-candy.  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings.  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill.  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today.  Don't be fooled  by Kartia's age or lack of popularity. This is a solid buy.  FFT fans, run-  kill only if necessary- to grab a hold of this monster.  2P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival. In return for your forty bucks you'll get the  chance to trade items with a friend, and get sucked into a extremely  addictive play!</td><td>RPGs, you gotta love em'</td><td>968457600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>589</td><td>4.0</td><td>16</td><td>false</td><td>11 26, 2001</td><td>AQ7OZH6CSCTY6</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days, so it's nice when a good one comes along. Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64, but instead of riding karts, your riding snowboards. Now in my biased opinion, I love snowboarding games, and this one was a classic among my friends and me. I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game. It had hilarious sound effects, great controls, a few varieties of boards to chose from, and solid looking graphics. It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead. What's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run. To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift, but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious. The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from, and they're all little kids. In other games like Mario Kart, there is more characters to chose from, but the character choices are only a minor con. It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids.  But once you can \"read past its cover\" the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family. It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off. Overall, I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting, and in my opinion, better than Mario Kart 64.</td><td>Very Fun Game</td><td>1366675200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>593</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>02 18, 2006</td><td>A305MT5Y9I4T69</td><td>B000009QD1</td><td>Charles B Valentino</td><td>This wasn't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64. I agree with this comparison. However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks. One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift. This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair, it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over. I love this dynamic! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone. Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash. Money earned during a race can also be used to \"buy\" weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course. I also ought to mention the music; it's wonderful!!! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua. You'll dig the energy the music provides.

Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those \"other agents\" who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break.  Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue. Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces.  While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game. If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.</td><td>A good mystery game for X-Philes</td><td>1046822400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>596</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>02 13, 2001</td><td>A160AB64G2E949</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>B.

Scully & Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the \"bad\" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer.

The game is good, perhaps a little  disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's  desk, doing nothing :) Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows  quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide  where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is  rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in  the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a  couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week. The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep  the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major  developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite  intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections. Buy this game if  you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And  you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.</td><td>It's a good entertainment</td><td>966643200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>598</td><td>5.0</td><td>20</td><td>false</td><td>07 27, 2000</td><td>A3S87ZOPB3UM9N</td><td>B00000DMAN</td><td>atmj</td><td>As a fan of Myst and Riven, I would not put this game in the same  category.  However, it does equally well for it's type.  Myst and Riven  don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you  have a name and a face. The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore.  He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully.  As an X-files fan, I found this game very  entertaining.  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games.  There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc.  This was well  within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining. I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria.  Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which  I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons.  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point  would be to save often.  I got killed alot. The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next.  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up. All in all a good buy.

Twisted Metal 3 is like an abomination that should have never been made.  989 ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal 2 one of the best games ever made.  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better.  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play.  Everything got worse instead of better. Story and Characters They brought back the taxi from the first game, added a grandma and a Flower Power 60's car.  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all 3 suck.  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the 2nd game like Shadow and Mr. Slam for those 3 and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies.  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same.  The story is pretty much the same but uses 3D graphics instead of the animation theme.  I personally thought the animation from 2 was great and added a lot of fun to the game.  I loved beating TM2 with each character to see the multiple endings.  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game. Play Control Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles.  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy.  The wonderful freeze element in TM2 does not work near as well in this game.  The play control in TM2 was outstanding, every vehicle was easy to learn and play.  Not so in this monstrosity. Stages & Backgrounds The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you don't get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game.  The cars all stay pretty close to you, so you don't do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages.  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava.  Instead you get Egypt, The North Pole, Washington DC, London and Tokyo.  None of which is very exciting. I found the background boring and uninspiring. Challenge This game is cheap as hell, but not in the way you would think.  Instead of all the cars fighting each other, it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always 4 to 1 or 5 to 1 instead of even.  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups, that's right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again.  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me.  What programmer would add that in.  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating.  When I died in TM2 I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time.  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal. The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid. Verdict Avoid this game like the plague.  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game.  the endings and stories are not as good, the play control is awful.  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics. The radar is not really helpful.  All in All it is the worst game in the series.  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal 1 or 2.

Still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game later. Twisted Metal 2: Most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramatically... Twisted Metal 3: In this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasn't as fun. This was 989 studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like 3 the best. However a few of the early twisted metal fans like 3 better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all.  In the end 989 failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiral. Twisted Metal 4: This game still made by 989 studios and after twisted metal 3 alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun.  I would say compared to 1 and 2 the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars.  I think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal 4 if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game.  This game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was.  This is the last twisted metal game for the playstation 1. Twisted Metal Black: First Playstation 2 release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name Incognito entertainment.  Best Graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games.  With nearly as many features as 4 including the first twisted metal game that was online capable(with a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now)  this game is considered the best by playstation 2 fans and many fans of the twisted metal series. Twisted Metal Head On: This is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal 2 its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number 2 however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number 2 it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worse.</td><td>Twisted Metal Series Review</td><td>1386115200</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>622</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>06 16, 2013</td><td>A22QYM5WUYSKHK</td><td>B00000DMB6</td><td>Travis Foster</td><td>Although I should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition I was not satisfied.

Seek out enemy, kill and move to the next level, and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles, so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters, locations, car, weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however, the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning.

The reason that this game suck's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic, the special effects are NOT shocking at all, you can't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction, many characters look lame, if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up, and many stages are VERY small.

This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark.

The trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of Midway's Mortal Kombat or else a James Cameron's Terminator take on a demolition derby. In it, a horde of over-the-top characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles, freeze rays, and other assorted weapons of destruction. This time out, there are a few new cars and weapons, and you have an option to have a computer-controlled ally aide you in the tournament, though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight. The biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from SingleTrac (who've started a new, but like-minded, auto-combat series under the moniker Rogue Trip for GT Interactive) to 989 Studios, a Sony-owned development studio. This affects the game on nearly every level. Graphically, the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line, though it's not necessarily improved. There are various shading and lighting effects at work, but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out. The title's soundtrack, which is comprised of songs by Rob Zombie and Pitch Shifter, is very fitting, but the supporting sound effects are very weak. For example, the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to that. The game's much-touted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function. The cars will now dip and roll upon collision, which sounds fantastic in theory, but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman. The collision detection is also highly suspect, as instances where you'll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent. It's very nice to have analog control this time, but the physics engine really works against it. The main downfall of Twisted Metal III though is its lackluster level design. Most of the stages are, if not modeled after, extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games, and those that aren't are even more uninspired. The Washington level, for instance, is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere (which sends vehicles to the ramped area) on the other. Snore. In the two player modes, the default horizontal split-screen runs into the same problem found in SingleTrac's Rogue Trip. Since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous TM games, having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or ramp-heavy levels. Fortunately, the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of split-screen perspectives, such as a vertical cut and variations on a four-way split where the other two boxes are filled with radar, speedometer, and weapons info (these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen). In the three- and four-player modes, the perspective is similarly cornered. Both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces, but not majorly. Multiple views aside though, the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player. As there, you'll be struck with the feelings of \"Why am I here?\" and \"Why am I playing this\" after a level or two. There are a few good ideas at work within Twisted Metal III (such as the multiple perspectives), but they're not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards, making the game a real lemon overall. If this is the direction the series is taking, it should probably stop right here. Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.</td><td>good game</td><td>1062720000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>639</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 15, 2012</td><td>A2OUKHGJ85XN4U</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Charles H.</td><td>I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played. Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire! Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions. Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots. Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect. Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is? It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.</td><td>The Force Is Strong In This Game</td><td>1344988800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>640</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>04 1, 2011</td><td>A1JAICBAZ3YHF1</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>michael</td><td>star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you're not a star wars fan you won't regret it</td><td>star wars rogue squadron ROCKS</td><td>1301616000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>641</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>10 29, 2010</td><td>AV56CQTOGFTCJ</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Jake</td><td>This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made.

Probably for my third time through at this point!  While Unreal doesn't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments!  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it's time.  It boasted great graphics and intense game play.  Of course by 2008's standards these graphics merely look silly!  But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was, you were pretty impressed. I figure I'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system, since I experienced some issues here and there.  Being a game made for Windows 98 it doesn't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system.  I have no idea what this would do on Vista's 64 bit architecture.  Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to \"ignore\".  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine.  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that \"ignore\" message comes up as well.  I'm not sure if this is just my system, but I recommend saving quite frequently, at least every time you hit a \"load\" screen.  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you.  This can be frustrating if you've been playing for a while, because it doesn't auto save between load screens.  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system.  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP.  Oh and this was on a Pentium 4, 3.0 ghz system. That being said, I'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time.  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health.  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner.  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship.  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level, but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet.  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you.  Outside it's very bright and vibrant in spots.  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake, Half Life, Doom, because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them.  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well, but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery.  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge!  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it. As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what's going on with this planet called Na Pali.  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj.  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I can't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part.  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game, though not the only enemy creatures you'll face.  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit.  You'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator.  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator.  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms.  As you can see this isn't very original.  Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across.  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology.  Strangely you come across large castles that look like they're straight out of thirteenth century England.  I know... strange for a race of pacifists.  Despite all this, those parts are some of the most fun to play through.  I loved going into the castles and running around! Another aspect that made Unreal very special, when compared to other FPS games, was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game.  It truly does feel like you're on an alien world.  The sounds, the textures, were all there perfectly bringing you into this world, almost so much that you didn't want to leave!  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you're walking through a cavern, it's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user.  For it's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world.  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted.  So when I'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots.  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life. The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times.  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon.  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers, or whatever, in order to proceed onto the next section.  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete, so you really get your moneys worth.  The downfall to having such large maps is it's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you're trying to complete certain tasks.  Another detriment to the game was the lighting.  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going.  Sometimes that wasn't even bright enough.  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark, especially towards the end of the game.  While this creates a very scary atmosphere, I felt it hindered the game play once in a while.  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with.  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas.  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something, but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes.  Seriously, the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it's up to you to go find another one.  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light, you can't enjoy the environment nearly as much. Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it.  In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year.  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line.  Unfortunately Unreal's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things.  The user doesn't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles.  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control.  Unreal just couldn't compete with something of that caliber and it's not nearly as engrossing on that level.  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall, but not the best of the year.

I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high. But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission. I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well.

Jongeling</td><td>Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now, I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III, while having an initial gleam at first play, it wears itself out fairly quickly. The gleam I'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play. It tries to be something new, which it is, but it improves in all the wrong ways. Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory. Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory, you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have. For example, I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more. The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles (more on that in a bit). In previous TM installments, you could keep building your homing missile capacity, and carry only those, as long as you didn't exceed the max capacity. Annoying. New Weapons. Okay, so initially I thought the (((Rain Missile))) was the best thing since sliced bread. But really, the rain missile doesn't do very much apart from visual appeal. The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it, and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms. It doesn't do the damage the napalm does, but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire...at least until they turbo (stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers) out of it 2 seconds later. Minimal damage done. The introduction of the (((Speed missile))) was the worst mistake of the weapon category. It's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets. If you can fire them fast, you can do some damage, but they're so useless during combat that it really doesn't even matter. (((Remotes))) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2. (((Freeze missiles))) (the left-right-up maneuver) do not hit enemies like they used to. It is much harder to freeze an enemy. This can be frustrating. Enemies. New characters are added, some are great, some not so great. Your enemies now have the A.I. that allows them to steal items from in front of you. If they need health, they will race you for it and take the health. This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health. *Cue controller hitting floor* The levels are not very large. Not much scenery and not much to discover. There's a few hidden places you can find to explore, but for the most part it's very limited. All in all, TM3 falls flat. The previous installments are much better both in game-play value, and in overall playability. If you can find this cheap, get it.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.</td><td>Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64</td><td>1031788800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>660</td><td>2.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>03 28, 2002</td><td>A3SF50Z5Q7PJA4</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Casey Aytes</td><td>Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine. The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says \"Mission Complete\" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied.</td><td>Not that loyal to the movie</td><td>1017273600</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>661</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2001</td><td>AK3DY70GYZB2G</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Rex Marksmanson</td><td>If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing.  \"Rogue Squadron\" pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother).  The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer.  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships.  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it.  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them.  Can't get you're hands on the new Rogue Squadron \"Rogue Leader\" for Gamecube? Pick this up to satisfy you're urge, if you do own Rogue Leader or even don't plan on getting it, pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience.</td><td>One of the greater games to appear on Nintendo 64</td><td>1006560000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>662</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 19, 2001</td><td>A3GRU9732S4V1U</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Robert</td><td>LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game.  After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth.  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born.  You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions.  You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back.  The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities.  Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder.  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions.  After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance.  After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score.  The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold. The look and feel of the game is excellent.  The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels.  The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive.  The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice.  Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls.  The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth. As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy.  But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down.  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission.  Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while. The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well.  As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor.  There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter.  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire!  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get.  There are several sites on the Internet that have them. It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game.  Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn.  For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64.  It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.</td><td>I just love blasting TIE'S....</td><td>1006128000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>663</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 9, 2001</td><td>A10EAONPHFORLH</td><td>B00000DMB2</td><td>Joshua Swanson</td><td>This game is great for Star Wars fans!

The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals.

You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race).

First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the \"Z\" button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that \"PRETTY MUCH\" the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select \"Restart\" from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!! I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64. 9/10</td><td>Finally; a great snowboarding game.</td><td>1144540800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>684</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>11 2, 2001</td><td>A37QIM8W556IMQ</td><td>B00000DMAO</td><td>Teresa A.

The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.   It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head.  There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.   This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player.

The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.

My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the \"Black Diamond\" level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.

The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal. The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more. The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game. 1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit. 1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.

I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together. Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it. Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like \"Did you preorder this!!\". I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to \"I wonder what happens after this...\". I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic. I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before. The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia. Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it. Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner. In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary.

Why was that all necessary for this one game? It's just that DAMN AWESOME! This game has everything! Story, characters, battle system, music, humor and more! If it didn't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after? Because it was just damn awesome!

It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantec's Norton web site refers to as: \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\".  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it! To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to: [...] That page at Norton doesn't specifically refer to \"Final Fantasy VII\", but for those that want to know for sure that what I'm stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of: [...] In the web page that pops up into view; enter: \"Final Fantasy VII\"  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard.  A page with three options will comeup.  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds.  The next one is about the XP 1.5 version upgrade, and that has an additional worm in it.  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI & FF XII.  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds.  Thast one will automatically go to the computer's  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there.  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself. My advise though Norton doesn't state it; is to destroy every copy of the PC version of \"Final Fantasy VII\" that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world. In the file about \"IRC W32 Tibick Activity\" the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems.  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well.  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well. I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well.  I'm going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise.  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made!!!

I have over 120+ hours played on my game save.  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack.  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way.  The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos.  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure.  My tip: don't give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it.  FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure.  My only tip: don't save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you won't be able to exit it if you do. Replayability: ***** (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.) Gameplay: ***** (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun) Story: ***** (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING) Graphics: ***** (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff.  More crisp than the PSone version) Controls: **** (Takes a while to get used to, you won't want to try another control setup once you do) Sound: ***** (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game) Addictiveness: ***** (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play.  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game.  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldn't be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I haven't uninstalled from my computer.  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and don't be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.

The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development. FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle (Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on) FFII- wound-developable characters (Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.) FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills) FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin) FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it) FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills) FF7- basic weapon system FF8- GF system FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>1131148800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>697</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 29, 2004</td><td>A24XAFHKD0NT28</td><td>B00000DMAA</td><td>cloud_mcaeris</td><td>FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world, in fact, it is my whole world.

From the moment i entered the tree, my deepest childish heart was immersed by The spooky chilling song of wonderus oblivion,  played with a dida jiu, envoks the dark gothical environment of smokey earth, a hidden sign of our own earthly desires and self destruction. the rest of the music is amazing and fits each place perfectly. I really like the hyrule field song of mystery and adventure. You gather items such as slingshots, bombs, magic spells, and the sword of time. This allows you to go to times and alter the other time to your advantage. The sun and moon take turns with night and day as you run through a beautiful hyrule field, a fire mountain and other magical places.

Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters.  But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it? Here's the story.  Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him.  His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way.  It's a lousy life to have. Especially if you're already dead. That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead.  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in.  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?). Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive.  He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest.  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years. Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time.  So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client. And that's when he gets in over his head. The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton.  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible.  It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny.  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake. Yes, it's an old game, I know.  But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.  So take advantage of the price, snap it up, and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent.  He's waiting for you...</td><td>Buenos dias!</td><td>1117756800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>723</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 20, 2005</td><td>A3PH8U2NU1YGJL</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>R.

The game centers around Manny Calavera who is attempting to stay honest and make sense out of a Hispanic day of the dead afterlife which has been corrupted by those who control that afterlife for their own gain. All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife! Confused? Trust me, it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked. I've tried a lot of the adventure games and they all have their flaws. But Grim Fandango comes as close to perfect as any game ever will.

I originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world,  the characters, and the dozens of things to do. You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world. I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns. This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons?

You follow the character Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the dead, guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible. For some reason, Manny is denied any premium clients.

It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be. But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller).

Blessen</td><td>Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition.  The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore,  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter. Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements.  The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the  characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes  Mexican folk melodies. The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure,  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my  children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating. The interface in this game is unusual. Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's  movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking \"enter\" to see what  happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at  times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story. The  puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error.  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That  aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventure.</td><td>Original and Literate</td><td>957571200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>742</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>05 3, 2000</td><td>A233JF1T2IIBLT</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Genesis Whitmore</td><td>I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango.  An adventure game with polygons?  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone?  But I gave it a try.  Thank  goodness I did. Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel  agent for the souls of the dead.  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday. Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun.  Add  big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango. The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch.  It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but  somehow this game pulls it off.  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another. The things  that make a good adventure game are all there.  Logical puzzles that don't  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good  acting, good animation, and good code!  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone, this would be it.</td><td>Probably the best adventure game ever made</td><td>957312000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>743</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>04 28, 2000</td><td>A243HY69GIAHFI</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>tropic_of_criticism</td><td>Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution.  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed.  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat  culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory  explosion.  Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its  graphics realistic.  Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect.  Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself.  Its first-rate direction and hitherto  unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games. True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them  really seem out of place.  Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true  sense of plot.  Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or  great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do  maintain charming integrity throughout. If I have a complaint with the  game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with  others.  You choose from among several sentence options, like those old  \"choose-an-ending\" books.  It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I  suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast.  As a  result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple.  Of course, there aren't  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized. Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly.  It does speed game  play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be.  This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet.  Speed-of-play matters.  So, even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available. Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you  should still buy _Grim Fandango_.  Likewise, if you don't have time to play  adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good.  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be heading.</td><td>LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future</td><td>956880000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>744</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>04 4, 2000</td><td>A3N1V8LIFT0RU6</td><td>B00000DMAD</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...

It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really! Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game. The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives. Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters.

It looked to childish, to easy, and just basically stupid.  Comming from the  epic company Rareware, I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about.  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.  And even little guys called Jinjo's are here for you to collect,  so they can help you on your journey, through a forest, islands, deserts,  and many other worlds.  If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done.  The music is  also a plus feature on this game.  With so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes, you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this game.</td><td>So much fun, it's not even funny.</td><td>965260800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>811</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 12, 2014</td><td>A2D66KSHQQHOSD</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Green Level Clearance</td><td>Hands down the hardest game of the first three.  The graphics were better and Lara had new moves.  But the game took an almost insane turn for hardness.  Not the best pick for your first Tomb Raider experience. The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?

This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything. But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more. Brings back Eidos' weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the 90s full force (All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs, as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon.

I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty. If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that. Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?) It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point. By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison. At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least. Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it. BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you.  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end).  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer.  Very legitimate.  Same as, \"Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery\" (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)!  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay.  It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing.  The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief.  But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.</td><td>Not difficult, impossible.

It was a better instruction manual than the booklet! I also love how the footage was taken from the beta version of the game. With its promotional montage, you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conker's game another cartoony adventure rather than the adult-oriented one they ended up making.  - Anyway the game is fantastic, a perfect supplement to Super Mario 64. In some ways it's actually better. When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats, to just have fun and explore. I played it enough times to 100% the game in two hours.

It only costs you $11.00 for the WII VC version, so do the math, fools!

I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me? The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at. Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire \"Story So far...\" feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels. Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!! Yippee. Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck! But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3. If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize \"L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2\" if you want to beat this game!</td><td>TOO HARD</td><td>1086998400</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>834</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>07 25, 2002</td><td>A3JX74J0LE924A</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Lisa Houghtaling</td><td>This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.

Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it. Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either. You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money. Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term. It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme. But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games. If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely. Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times. But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.</td><td>Lara's the One (on the Playstation)</td><td>966297600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>847</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>10 3, 2016</td><td>AV8PFPPTB6I5V</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Jared Phillips</td><td>One of if not the best game on the n64.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1475452800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>848</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>08 6, 2016</td><td>A198I1P469E3L8</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>leif hudson</td><td>It's okay, but I still don't see why everyone talks about this game.

I still have yet to beat the last level \"Cradle\" and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years, and yet I am addicted to trying over and over. I finished the Campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties. Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo. There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is. No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day.

Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered. REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers. REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode. If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends.

It is the best of the best. The levels are action packed and extremely memorable. I can do the levels in my head I've played them so many times. The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best. Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5 Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5 Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/ Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5 Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5 Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more.

I still remember that commercial from the late 90s. It told us that a \"dark time is approaching.\" My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought \"ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything!\" I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers! A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the \"Best Game of All Time\" by some, and the \"Most Overrated Game of All Time\" by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play. Story: You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a \"Princess of Destiny,\" and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself. Gameplay: To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it. Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that \"You can go wherever you want.\" That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it. Controls: They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process. Ocarina of Time introduced a \"Z-targeting system\" for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it. Music: *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part. Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :P Oh, and I'm sad to report that the \"OoT Commercial Music\" is not in this game... :( Replay Value: It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations. Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the \"Three Heart Challenge,\" which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard). But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage. ______ If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

Berk</td><td>GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market.  If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release. This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges.  The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer. The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature.  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head.  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts.  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks.  AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry.  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games.  So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience. (Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)</td><td>One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!</td><td>1238371200</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>890</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 26, 2013</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series. One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too. The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust. While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game. Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness. The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there. The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration. The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time. Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies. The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot. If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence. Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting. Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die. Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be). Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!</td><td>a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star</td><td>1374796800</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>891</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>07 4, 2013</td><td>A36QIF5IIJ5EJX</td><td>B00000DMB3</td><td>K_Renny</td><td>One of the best games of all time.

All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil. Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of.

Morelock</td><td>I have fond memories of this game, and still get together to play it with friends. Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with \"slappers only.\" In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill. The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different. The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives). Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it. This is Rare's N64 Masterwork ( Perfect Dark is pretty sweet, too).</td><td>Nobody Does It Better- The Defining Console Shooter</td><td>1204588800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>898</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>01 8, 2008</td><td>A1DH48UGGWMG5P</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>gmt_749</td><td>I am a major player of 007 games.

GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion, even better than the movie) and long missions, which allow a lot of replay value.

Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter. The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun. Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life, but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare's wonderful game.

You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems. The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it. There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby. The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there. Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000. If you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.</td><td>Same as the original</td><td>1108512000</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>918</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 22, 2013</td><td>A10EICDA6FL5VK</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Johnny B.

You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes, Jinjos, Mumbo tokens, feathers, etc. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole.

It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent. There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die. Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill. Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening. The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away. This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.</td><td>Difficult</td><td>1120953600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>922</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>03 22, 2005</td><td>AD0J5KK4WQXNS</td><td>B00000DMAT</td><td>OverTheMoon</td><td>Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone (N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it!!!) and bonded friends and family for years on end.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases.

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome. Buy it you won't regret it.</td><td>Banjo Kazooie</td><td>1376438400</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>936</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 12, 2013</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"</td><td>banjo kapooie</td><td>1376265600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>937</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>06 19, 2013</td><td>AJPTIO3SH82S7</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>brutusmuktuk</td><td>Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations. This isn't a knock against them. William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces. Rare is gamedom's Shakespeare, in that regard. Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64, although it's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece. While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64's magic and ingenuity, it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo's behemoth. The Good: + A fun story + An imaginative use of its characters + Creative worlds to explore The Bad: -- Too easy and short -- The few parts that are too hard The Ugly ? Why is Kazooie so insulting? Story--9/10 The first thing that stands out is the dialogue, especially of the evil witch, Gruntilda, or Grunty, who speaks in clever rhymes. It's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny. The game begins with her asking her mirror, \"Who is the most beautiful of them all?\" Of course, it couldn't be Gruntilda. There's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat, green hag. The most beautiful of them all is Banjo's younger sister, Tooty (who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame). So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds, leaving only the mole, Bottles, as a witness. Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie. The question becomes, can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself? Gameplay--8/10 Here is the game's bane and boon. Everything else sets it up wonderfully. The soundtrack is great, the visuals are very nice, and the opening story sequence is funny. The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout. The levels are varied, with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover. But these levels are so small, so short, so easy. I never spent an hour and a half on any one level, and most of them took less than an hour to complete. In that time, I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces, one hundred musical notes, and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls, extra lives, and Jinjos. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all? There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose. Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather. Unless you use cheats, it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world, including the final fight with Grunty. That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake. More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing). These are mostly criticisms, but they comprise a small percent of the game. You will spend most of it enjoyably. Despite the very easy difficulty, it isn't boring. There's plenty to explore in the levels, and as they go on, they become larger and more complex, especially the sprawling final level. Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level, revolving around the four seasons, and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters. Not that the other levels are clunkers, but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment, the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable. Longevity--5/10 A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer. Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude. But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64. Most gamers will complete this, all 100 Jigsaw pieces, almost all 900 music notes, in less than twelve hours. After finishing it, there's no reason to go back. The cheats only give you infinite resources, but what's the point when you've already finished the game? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer.</td><td>A bird in a backpack is worth more than two in a bush</td><td>1371600000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>938</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>06 7, 2013</td><td>ASFAJ90S77BZH</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Granny Samples</td><td>OMGosh !! . .

I wasn't to familiar with the C&C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series. If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way! The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at! There just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off! This is a good value for the money.

Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base! That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks... THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were). ....

I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend.

TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original C&C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and  there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole  lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee  aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i don't think so.  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&C such as the  devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust  me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I  personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as  well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran  barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is  about (no real actors - jus  bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games.  Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old C&C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they haven't been looking for, they disgrace the game.  We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if you're a  serious fan of C&C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have remembered.</td><td>Not a copycat of Red Alert; better than Starcraft</td><td>964224000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>948</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 21, 2013</td><td>A1E8F0AYFXPCRB</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Derrick</td><td>This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters.

Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.

Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since, and I too must agree with this well deserved honor. Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review. First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story. Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game. In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are, or how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing. And that's gameplay. And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay. In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and...well...Kazooie, and Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless. They both work as a team and learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles. Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty. But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda. The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them. Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth, or how to fly when you collect enough feathers. Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens. Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey. So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that. Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair. But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes. Why? You may ask. Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected. Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world and re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect. Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected. There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie, and it didn't take me long to master them. And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect. But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge. While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating. I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver. I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific. The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable. You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove, or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion. And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall and winter. I especially loved Freezeezy Peak, and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman. I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me, and the sound effects were great as well...well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming, and this game has this quality. What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well. It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times. I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me. I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original. Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic.</td><td>Banjo Kazooie</td><td>1283212800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>965</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 8, 2016</td><td>ANIOV3E6MR50R</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>jack harris</td><td>work as advertised.</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>1467936000</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>966</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 2, 2016</td><td>A2TKKB683DPZXU</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Avidshopr83</td><td>Works but have to clean every time, love the game</td><td>love the</td><td>1467417600</td><td>0</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>967</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 7, 2009</td><td>A24JQTKGA5RAKX</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>JoeAZ92</td><td>Positive: + gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time + worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content + music tracks are great and change in style when you're in different spots + sharp controls that work well for the most part Negative: - you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world - camera doesn't always give you the best view you need Super Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level, and possibly delivering a game that's even better than the root. Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really, really good at making games, that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie. Games of the platforming genre aren't exactly known for their amazing stories, and Banjo fares no different. Banjo's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda. She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty's beauty to herself, and this will leave Banjo's poor sister ugly in the process! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth. The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge.' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game. There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard, and many other spots. The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse, and have a lot of stuff to find. You'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game, then moving on to a beach, and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world, and so on. The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too. Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn. In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him. These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on, and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically. You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight and invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair, and also to accomplish more in the worlds. The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves, and it doesn't get too complicated. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room or area. But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit. The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world. Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair. Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts. This is pretty annoying sometimes, and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds. Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough. The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough, and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed. Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times. One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound. The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen) and this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character. The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there. The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music. The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song. Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style, and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool. Mario 64 may have been the revolution, but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better, in my opinion. Banjo-Kazooie is one such game, adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64, and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.

Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back. The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage. This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid.

Banjo's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping. It's up to you to get jiggy's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo's sister back. Graphics: 9.5/10. Awesomely different and creative worlds. From a sewer, to a pirate ship on an island, to a desert and into an icy snowland, there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through. The graphics are stellar for the N64, with bright colors and cool characters with good animations. This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Sound: 9/10. There aren't really any voices in this game; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character. Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he's burping or throwing up, Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird, Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear... and so on. The music in this game, though, is some of the catchiest and the best music i've heard in really any adventure game. The music doesn't really get old, and whoever created it is brilliant. Overall, the sound is really, really good. Control: 8.5/10. Being an adventure game, there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves. And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end, just because you go brain dead. The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks, but you will get used to them anyways. Fun: 9/10. A great game from beginning to end. Get the jiggys, move on. Get the notes, move on. That simple? No. This game is challenging and is for all ages, even if it does have a kiddy approach. The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game. Great characters, great level design, and fantastic music makes this a must buy. This is one of the best games on the N64, and I.M.O., the best adventure game. Pick this game up now; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones, even if all three are fantastic.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much.

Both are almost the same. If you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious, both are for you. Overall, since Banjo-Kazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzle-finding feature to it, I would suggest you pick up Banjo-Kazooie first and then either get Banjo-Tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game, or get Super Mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game.

HOPEFULLY! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever. In fact it's one of the most amazing games in any genre period. It took a while to beat the game, but it was well worth it. If your not familiar with B & K, let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack. Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo's backpack. With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often. Changing form is mandatory, for instance B & K cannot fit into some smaller places. Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise. Vast and adventurous, B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers. Even if your just watching, it's entertaining. I'll give you an idea of how effective the story is. BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games.</td><td>Hit the power and prepare to be impressed.</td><td>1053388800</td><td>1</td><td>video_games</td></tr><tr><td>984</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>12 23, 2002</td><td>A1FT8KT8EW7ZS9</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>uh... tim</td><td>Rareware - words fail me. Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination. Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt. 95 % of people agree, that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer, and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64's lifespan, the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released. The sound is equally as impressive (for N64), and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation. I am proud to say many people love this game. Many of my friends still play it occasionally, however few have beaten it all the way. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note, and every other item. Some people dislike it, and do not be fooled; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game. It is by no means for everybody. Many gamers, from preschool to high school will like it, but not everybody. The controls are easy enough to master, and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice. The sound is superb. The graphics are good, for an N64 title. There is not a dull moment in this game, and the attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles, the meat of the game, are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids. The puzzle peices, your reward for completeing a puzzle, are well hidden. The musical notes, the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld, are challenging to find. The most fun part of the game, visiting Mumbo, is quite enjoyable. He transforms you into various forms. A fat walrus, a termite, and even a bumble bee. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay. You get an occasional cinematic, but it's pretty basic. The story goes... The evil witch, Gruntilda, is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN... The \"cute\" Tootie, sister of Banjo the bear, strolls by. Overcome with jealousy, she sees Tootie is quite a bit \"cuter\" than her. So she kidnapps Banjo's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie's \"cuteness\" out and put it into her. Banjo and his sidekick breegull, Kazooie set off to find Tootie. A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game. Well, I hope you enjoy this game.

He therefore decided to bridge the gap, so to speak, and undertake this momentous task himself.  In so far as it is possible for someone to adequately accomplish this Herculean task of being both comprehensive and somewhat concise (the material is indeed covered in one volume, though 831 pages long), Roy Porter has succeeded.   Porter has an eye for the unusual, spicing up his reporting with examples of odd concoctions and practices used for various maladies down through the ages, such as the use of pulverized crocodile dung, various herbs, and honey as a contraceptive pessary among the ancient Egyptians, or the English resistance against legal revisions (including town sewer reform among other things) attempting to fight cholera in the 19th century: \"We prefer to take our chances with cholera and the rest rath! er than be bullied into health,\" reported THE TIMES.  Most refreshingly, he is not timid in rendering pronouncements for both good and ill on the medical profession, bringing a candor needed to assess the impact of medicine down through the ages.  He is thorough without being tedious, educational without being pedantic, and has a fine eye for comedy without being flippant.   As someone with an interest in history and by vocation a surgeon, I found Roy Porter's book a delightfully instructive volume to read.  I look forward to returning to peruse it many times in the years ahead.</td><td>Superb Medical History in One Volume</td><td>902016000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>1998-08-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Aug</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>1</td><td>266</td></tr><tr><td>17238</td><td>4.0</td><td>9</td><td>true</td><td>A1TAU5R8BSLKTC</td><td>0002151731</td><td>some guy on the internet</td><td>There is a solid narrative history of the up to 1800 or so and then he gives extended essays on a variety of topics like surgery, tropical medicine or public medicine.

I got as far as page 34 before I concluded that this book was never going to live up to its promise and was, in fact, a Marxist  polemic.  The book does does say who Roy Porter is, but from the tone of  the book it seems he is one of those trendy journalists (he surely cannot  be a scientist) who detest Western values and particularly Western  science. At page 34 readers are informed that \"the rebirth of the  underclass in the First World (results) from the free-market policies  dominant since the 1980s, (has) assisted the resurgence of disease\".  Oh dear.  This tosh merely reveals Porter's true colours and shows him to  be be short on history but long on leftist cliches.  And it goes downhill  from there.  Shortly after bad health in some of the third world are  attributed to that great leftist bugaboo, colonialism.  The fact that many  dirt poor third world countires got that way through through the  machinations of post-colonial home-grown dictators of a particularly  vicious and evil kind seems to have entirely escaped Porter's  attention. I then skimmed through the rest of the book and similiar  throw-away and absurdly wrong opinions abound.

Woodley</td><td>This is the second review of three I have done of socio-medical histories written of edited by Roy Porter (you can read the others on my reivew page).  I read and compared this to The \"Cambridge Illustrated History: Medicine\", and \"Gout, the Patrician Maladay\". I thought this was the best approach as people might be like me,  looking for a reference work to buy and trying to toss up between which one to get and what the advantages and disadvantages  of one over another. In terms of content I think this is the more comprehensive of the two general reference works. It is over twice the length of Cambridge (over 800 pages in this one compared to not quite 400). It also doesn't have pages taken up with illustrations as Cambridge does. That is probably the thing I like least about this book, there are only three small sections in the middle with some black and white pictures reproduced - I think on comparison I do prefer the slightly more expensive version of having pictures on the pages I am reading for this kind of reference work. The book is divided into 22 chapters which follow the rise of Western medicine more or less chronologically. There are also chapters included on Chinese and Indian Medicine, but expect the emphasis to be European in both history and development. Each chapter is divided into specific topics which are discussed a structure I quite enjoyed as it broke up the text and made it more readable. I looked up some specific subjects to compare this with the Cambrige work and in each case (among them Purperal fever, Galen, Resurrectionists) this book had far more detailed and comprehensive explanations, often citing broad statistics. However writing the a social and medical history of mankind is difficult to do full justice even in 800-some pages. It does give a slightly provide more detail but I wasn't really sure that the slightly greater detail was that much of an advantage to make up for the loss of illustration. In the end this is still only slightly more detail on broad trends rather than in-depth discussion. He does cover some people and subjects not dealt with in \"Cambridge\" including people like Dr James Barry, the first female surgeon (although she was masquerading as a man at the time) - but of course the space available doesn't allow Porter to discuss any of her other significant work as, in terms of forwarding the field of medicine, she was not earth-shattering. Porter has a very good-natured and readable style of writing though and I really enjoyed it. He breaks this chapters up into short sections and interspeses them with rather nice  jokes for instance on page 129 he writes of 'Trotula'said to be a female of 12th century medical school in Salerno but says \" 'Dame Trot' was more likely a male writing in drag.\" So while I very much enjoyed the book and would certainly have no qualms in recommending it to read at all, I do hold some reservations about it - but strictly in comparison with what else is available.</td><td>More a European History</td><td>978912000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-01-08</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jan</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>527</td></tr><tr><td>17235</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>AEP9LH0OOB3EX</td><td>0002151731</td><td>lanoitan</td><td>When I read the NYTimes review of this book I bought it with anxious anticipation.

It's a goal that Roy Porter attempts to make, and he succeeds to some extent. His primary theme is the development of Western Medicine in Europe and America, and as a historical work it is very well done.  He only briefly mentions Eastern medicine and rarely covers \"irregular\" medical practioners except to say that many members of the public subscribe to their folk remedies. What he does well is in his coverage of the breadth of the topic.  There is hardly an historical point he fails to mention, a significant doctor left out, or a disease left undiscussed.  His ability to breathe life into history is exceptional.  In what seems like just the span of a few pages, he has covered a huge swath of history seamlessly. However, the book suffers depth-wise.  There isn't hardly enough space to give deep coverage to every topic and Porter skims past many historical items and persons without a second word.  The book also has the problem of grouping photos and illustrations together far from the textual contexts that they arise from. What is most saddening about the history of medicine is that while we have progressed very far in the understanding of disease, we haven't come very far at all in understanding how to Cure disease.  Porter pushes this point home as the book draws to a close.  What progress has been made has been made primarily in the 20th century with the greater level of technologic progress and antiseptic techniques.  However, despite that, acute diseases that vexed humanity for ages still haunt us and chronic diseases that lay dormant in our genes are coming to the fore.  The future may hold cures for the diseases we suffer from, but if history is any guide, then management of those diseases is a more likely outcome. This book works well as a survey of the history of Western Medicine.  It provides jumping off points to further research on any number of topics that the reader may not have been previously familiar with.  His bibliography and Further Reading sections are chock full of additional texts that will serve anyone wanting more depth.  I highly recommend this book.</td><td>Hefty, tries to cover everything, but lacks details</td><td>1122336000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-26</td><td>Tue </td><td>Jul</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>413</td></tr><tr><td>17304</td><td>3.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A25NXTINE0L7KS</td><td>0002151731</td><td>D.

My main point, though, is that the author seems to think that Western medicine is hardly more valid than any of the other alternatives, and his conclusion is that while it has had some successes the result may be that we are about back where we started, with new ailments replacing the old.  The author does not seem to see this as simply an understandable consequence of success.  Maybe we would be better off just going back to the 19th century (or before)?</td><td>Western medicine and its discontents</td><td>1270339200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2010-04-04</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>17303</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</td><td>0002151731</td><td>Gio</td><td>... will probably be the development of your biceps from holding this ponderous tome in front of your eyes for the several months that it may take you to finish it! Yes, this is a mercilessly ample and detailed account of the history of medical thought and practice. It's mercifully non-technical, however, and gracefully written, and certainly worth the labor of reading it if you're at all interested in the history of science. At least seven-eighths of the text is devoted to Western - that is, European-based - medical developments; forgive my bias here, but that's how it should be. There are unquestionably omissions - Thank Aesculapius! - but none that matter much in the sweep of such an encyclopedic narrative. Extremely well-informed readers may find points of contention in it. I didn't, but I'd never claim to be well-informed about medical matters. Some wag has 'tagged' this book on amazon as a 'very short introduction'. Ho ho ho! You may wonder why it took me so long to read this book, given that I pride myself on fast reading. Frankly, I couldn't absorb so much info in a single dosage. I picked the book up and put it down dozens of times, perusing a chapter or a sub-chapter at a time. It's the sort of reading matter that makes one wish knowledge could be delivered intravenously.</td><td>The Greatest Benefit to Your Personal Well-Being ...</td><td>1275868800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2010-06-07</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jun</td><td>39</td><td>39</td><td>9</td><td>227</td></tr><tr><td>17279</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A216Z0U39DSX21</td><td>0002151731</td><td>Matthew M.

Would that I had \"The Greatest Benefit to Mankind\" back then! It seems that Roy Porter's students had the same issue which is what inspired the teacher-turned-author to write this book. Porter's historical account of medicine and healing is fascinating and delves deep to reveal how people's attitudes toward medicine has changed over the years,  including the big breakthroughs. While the book covers a global history, it is primarily European - which is explained by the fact that \"Western medicine has developed in ways which made it uniquely powerful and... uniquely global.\" Sounds a bit like the power of imperialism... The book is a refreshing read and is certainly anything but boring. His tone is comical, engaging, enlightening, and that of a lecturer all at once. Porter has structured his work perfectly and the chapter titles give you the option to quickly look up what you need to know if you're in a hurry. Perfect if you're a student!

Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths.  You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them.  When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment.

Forced into marriage the next morning to salvage her reputation, she gradually begins to trust the tenderness and respect with which her noble husband eventually wins her. The period detail and writing literally draw you into the story, weaving a lush tapestry against which the splendid romance between the strong heroine and the persistent hero unfolds beautifully. Red Adam is not only patient and kind as he endeavors to win Julitta's affections, but he is strong and intelligent, recognizing in Julitta an equal, worthy partner and giving her full control of the household whenever he must ride out. Facing impudent serving wenches, a resentful chatelaine, an insolent comrade of Red Adam's, and even a thieving cook, Julitta has her hands full with the running of the estate and all its inherent problems, not to mention the whisper of mystery surrounding the former lord. Throw into that brew political unrest and rebellion, raiding Scotts, betrayal and breathtaking escape, and you have a truly dynamic, potent tale. There is just so much more to the story than the above.  A true bond between the characters, genuine affection, and several subplots, all threads being masterfully combined. Any summary is inadequate.  But if you like adventure, a mystery interwoven throughout, compelling history that draws you into its pages, true love in the truest sense, and blazing triumph over adversity, then this is your book!

There is something romantic about a man literally having some sense knocked into him.  Unlike so many romances of the time that had the love interest fight each other to the end then suddenly they are in love, Ms. Ingram gradually brings Julitta from  dislike, to grudging respect, friendship and then love.

Adam takes Julitta back to his keep bent on rape, but the ever resourceful Julitta knocks him out with a stool and when he's sober Adam marries her to assuage her damaged honor. Julitta is none too thrilled with the match, but sparks soon fly between the two as Julitta's uncle Lord William and his cronies conspire to support young Henry in his plan to oust his father Henry II and rule England instead. Julitta also soon finds her hands full with a castle and mutinous servants allowed to run to ruin by the previous lord of Brentborough (Adam's uncle), a thieving seneschal, invading armies of Scots, a perilous climb down ocean cliffs, a mysterious death or two and more as \"Red\" Adam and his lady banter their way through it all to find true love in the end. While I very much enjoyed this book, at times it was a bit too busy and fast paced for my tastes. At times I lost track of who was who when characters from the first part of the book returned back to the story and the author didn't provide enough background to refresh my memory, and I got lost more than once until I fell back into the groove. A cast of characters and their various names and titles would have helped quite a bit and enhanced my appreciation of the story. That said, it was a highly enjoyable romp through the 12th century and a very entertaining read.

They are in getting ready to go to sleep and she tells him that if she ever calls him husband he will know that she is his. Which really matters at a later time. There are deer flapping at the oat cakes they were going to have to breakfast, and wild painted scots bent on murder. It's really a beautiful story.

When her path and that of the newly inherited lord of the district cross, fate steps in. Red Adam, drunk and mistaking Julitta for a peasant, abducts her to his castle, intent on ravishment. She barely fights him off, knocking him unconscious. So begins one of the best love stories I have ever read in my 40 years of avid readership. With forced marriage, uprising against the king, betrayal within the castle, and invasion by the unholy Scots, this novel has everything.

This is not your run-of-the-mill bodice rippers; this is actually a historically correct, realistic, and totally fascinating story. Ingram takes you right into the details and politics of what life was like for the real people, not the perfumed toadies in court. The times were perilous and things could (and did!) change in the blink of an eye. Julitta is one of the strongest fictional heroines I've read, and I love how the relationship between her and Red Adam develops. They're not perfect people, but they are honorable and they are perfect for each other. Even if Julitta doesn't believe it for quite a while -- maybe because she doesn't. This is not a hot, lustful romp; it's a love story set in a dangerous historical time, and it's really the best \"historical romance\" I've ever read.</td><td>This is a love story, not a romance</td><td>1346630400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2012-09-03</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>11254</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2WMEXIJ5Y9SU1</td><td>0002216973</td><td>Nina bellon</td><td>Not in the least liberated or politically correct.

The ravisher is none other than Red Adam, drunk as a skunk with his loutish friends and also on his way home.  Here you have two people who start out as enemies. Red Adam is everything she abhors in men: loud with the manners of a caveman and morals that are as low as a rock on the ground.  Mistaken, he thinks she is bashful until she bites him.  The description of these two going at it is so good you will think you are a fly on the wall in the room.  And then she knocks him out with a stool. Unable to leave the room because his friends want their turn with her, she waits until Adam wakes up.  And then they verbally go at it again, tit for tat. Until he tells her to bar the door after he leaves and he will marry her the next day. And so begins the unusual courting-after-marriage to earn Julitta's love.  Ever so slowly, he earns her respect.  Gritty and raw at times, RED ADAM'S LADY is one of those books where the less you know about the story the better. More adventure than romance, Ms. Ingram did a good job of setting up the scenes and giving the reader a good sense of both place and time.

As a rule, his books tend to be short and to the point, filled with action and marked with innovative ideas. Running Blind is one of my personal favorites (actually I think it is his best work) which I suddenly stumbled upon after many years. Allan Stewart, a retired intelligence agent is suddenly forced against his will to re-join the game just to complete one final assignment. Almost immediately, he finds himself in a maze of bluffs and double-bluffs. By a mix of good fortune and rusty skills, he escapes a trap and in doing so, stumbles almost by accident on the scary possibility that a top official in British intelligence may actually be a Russian mole (remember, this is a Cold War story). Of course, he now has to settle this question one way or the other. What follows is a terrific roller coaster of a story as Stewart (accompanied by his girlfriend), the mole, the Russians (including his opposite number thirsting for revenge after Stewart had long ago shot him in a very sensitive area!), and stray CIA agents engage in a fascinating pursuit over the Icelandic landscape, culminating in a shootout at the baddies hideout that is almost \"western\" in nature.

Book 4 was a lot of cut and paste from the previous three books with some updates on members of the younger generations.  Unexpected Blessings was less of a rehash and it followed the action from book 4 more smoothly.  I was happy to see that this story of Emma's great-granddaughters moved along without major inaccuracies from the first three books.  That being said, there are still gaps and minor errors.  For example, the relationship between Robin Ainsley and the rest of the Harte family continues from book four.  In book 4, this much improved relationship was not explained and remains unexplained in this book.  How Robin made it back into the graces of the family is a significant gap in the storyline between books 3 and 4.  This lack of explanation is more objectionable in book 4 because of the plot in that book, but it is still a mystery.  While it presumably relates to the secret revealed in book 4, the reader can only guess.  Those familiar with the first three books may find this is a very big disconnect.  One other mistake in this book is the recounting of the incident from the lives of Shane and Paula as children, wherein Shane paints Paula blue.  This incident actually occurred between Winston and Emily as is noted in book 2, \"Hold the Dream.\" I was taken aback by the vignette relating to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  This incident should have been developed more fully or omitted completely.  Yes, the event showed in a limited way what some people went through.  However, given the considerable wealth of the Hartes, O'Neills and Kallinskis, and the financial companies located in the World Trade Center at that time, isn't it likely that they would have been more affected than they were??

This book picks up in the summer of 2001, as Evan Hughes a newly discover relation of Emma Harte continues to get closer the Harte family as her own comes to England, while others members of the family are dealing with there own romantic relationship problems. I did enjoy this book more than \"Emma Secret\" but I can't understand why Ms. Bradford keeps doing the flashback chapters, its seems to pull away from the story.

I haven't and it was unbelievably boring.  How can a great grand mother who DIED OVER not 5, 10 or 15 but 30 YEARS AGO have so much influence on her family memebers. There is nothing that makes me care for the characters when all i read about is how much they are snobish and cliquey, and wealthy, privelged  and no outsiders allowed and Emma said this Emma said that. Its just not possible that family members down the line will mention emma's name evey single day of their lives. The book is also poorly written, so much exposition without any story. I througly hated this book. The writer should have ended with emma hartes story. The hartes are so elitist, i though i was reading about a secret society. Imagine ones daughter is kidnapped by her crazy father. What do you do? No, don't call the police because a long dead woman said no outsiders allowed. IT is much better if the father harms the child than having the GASP police(outsiders) involved. I am ranting now, but that book was a waste of time. I couldn't finish it.

Perhaps that's why we never get tired of reading of the adventures of Emma Harte and her descendants found in Barbara Taylor Bradford's novels. In UNEXPECTED BLESSINGS we find the great-granddaughters of Mrs. Harte struggling to find their way in a world that has changed considerably since that of their great-grandmother. From the bustling and busy streets of London to the quiet and beautiful moors of Yorkshire, however, age-old traditions, sense of history and family values are dominant. Evan Hughes, who arrived in England from America in EMMA'S SECRET, continues her work with Harte department stores and struggles with a secret that she would love to share with her father but fears might shatter his life as he knows it. Tessa Longden is engaged in a messy divorce and custody battle with a man who will stop at nothing to get his way. The only bright point is the new love she has discovered, but dare she hope it's one that will last? Linnet O'Neill is trying hard to forge a closer relationship with half-sister Tessa, but even business can come between the closest of sisters, much less two who have shared a lifelong rivalry. Last but not least, India Standish is involved in a breathtaking romance with a talented and dedicated artist who has secrets and prejudices that could come between them and wreck the best thing India has ever found. As if these day-to-day struggles are not enough, there are those who would wish the Harte descendants anything but good and will go to the greatest lengths to see them fall from their perch as one of England's strongest and most powerful families. Barbara Taylor Bradford continues to fulfill our need to know what happens to her descendants in UNEXPECTED BLESSINGS. She proves that she hasn't lost her touch and can still weave a fascinating story to follow the previous novels: A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE, HOLD THE DREAM, TO BE THE BEST and EMMA'S SECRET. While dedicated fans are sure to be entranced by the new adventures of characters who feel like old friends, new readers also will find themselves drawn into the elite lifestyle and family ties that bind the Hartes and will most likely look to the previous books to see where it all began.   --- Reviewed by Amie Taylor</td><td>A fascinating addition to the saga of a Yorkshire family</td><td>1106352000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-01-22</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jan</td><td>127</td><td>127</td><td>4</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>33118</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A17ZN80S1AMC9H</td><td>0002261367</td><td>Christopher Robin</td><td>I did finish the book, so I guess it wasn't all that bad, but it didn't seem to have much purpose and it wasn't that entertaining or interesting.

This book had too many characters, storylines and insufficient detail. I had the feeling the writing was rushed, written too quickly to get it to press and not enough time was taken to give both the characters and storyline the depth that Emma's descendants deserve and that was originally created in the first book. I thought the twin tower replay was in poor taste and was both overdramatized and underutilized in the story line. This book was, in short, boring and disappointing. A pity, because so much more could have been done with this series, as I have found that each successive book is rather lackluster.</td><td>Banal, boring and undercooked</td><td>1130889600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-11-02</td><td>Wed </td><td>Nov</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>33113</td><td>2.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR</td><td>0002261367</td><td>Gabriela Perez</td><td>I remember liking the earlier book where I was first introduced to Evan, et. al., but this one left me utterly cold. The first problem I had with it was keeping track of all the relationships being developed in the book. This might not have seemed such a hardship if I had actually come to care about any of the people about whom I was reading, but I couldn't identify with any of them. I tried to like them, mostly because I like sagas that take several books to wrap up and are filled with interesting people I might like to actually know, and I wanted this to be one series I looked forward to reading more from. Alas, it wasn't to be. I found the language stilted. My American perspective perhaps makes it hard to enjoy dialogue filled with phrases like \"my darling\" and \"darling ,\" and I may be judging based on my own impatience with that, but it just drove me nuts. Do people in Britain actually speak that way so much? I really would like to know that. My feeling is that they don't, if other reading experiences with British authors are any indication. Also, I found the characters truly flat. Rarely did they behave \"out of the box\"; in other words, if they were part of the good guy circle, they were highly unlikely to act in any questionable way whatsoever. And the \"good guys\" were unassailably good; if a man got tossed into the mix, he had to be handsome, learned, famous, wealthy, and almost hypnotically appealing to a female character who herself seemed too good to be true. Strong women always win (by a lot).  Annoying/destructive men always lose. People fall in love in seconds flat with the person they immediately understand will unlock the mystery of their lives. Oy. Beautiful people living beautiful lives of wealth and privilege, and nary a person in the bunch who is anything like anyone I know. This may be what some readers are looking for, but I'm looking for reading material that provides some characters not like me and some whose motivations, feelings, and language I can at least fathom as being realistic within my frame of reference. I made it through the book, mostly because I kept hoping it would get better. Then, at the very end of the paperback version, the publshers had included a snippet of the author's next book in this series, and I read that just to see what it promised. It looks like one of the central tensions in that book will be related to whether the flagship store will (gasp) change. Doesn't that just make you want to read that book? I mean, what's more enthralling than a battle over whether to redecorate or revamp a store? Nope, that definitely did not grab me.</td><td>Disappointing, at least for this reader</td><td>1139356800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2006-02-08</td><td>Wed </td><td>Feb</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>33112</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A27M1MQV9KFS5S</td><td>0002261367</td><td>dancermommd</td><td>I am only half way through it and am struggling.

Kirkman</td><td>This book is a continuation of Emma's Secret, beginning with Robin and Evan, and the knowledge that he is Owen's biological father, which Owen will find out later in this book. And Evan is becoming really close to her newly found grandparent. Tessa is having many problems in divorcing Mark Longden, her abusive husband. Near the beginning of the book, he kidnaps Adele, their 6-year-old daughter, and Tessa is out of her mind with worry. They manage to track Mark down though, and later Paula, makes him settle for an offer he can't refuse to keep him out of her daughter's life. He has to follow her instructions right down to the letter, and is forced to agree unless he wants to go to prison. India and Dusty are in a relationship together, but India has no idea at all that Dusty is hiding a secret and doesn't trust her enough to tell her. His ex, Melinda whom he had a child with, sees him with Dusty at his home painting her portrait, (Dusty is a great very well-known artist), and stabs him. He almost doesn;t make it in time to the hospital, and would not have had it not been for India who drove him there in the nick of time. Later in the book, Evan who is seeing Gideon, and plans to marry him is pregnant. Her father is very upset with this whole relationship, though her mom is openly thrilled about it. Her dad just doesn't want her to become related to the Harte family for his own personal reasons. This comes to light also, later in the book. These were the main points of the story, and overall I enjoyed the book. It does go back in time to the 1950's when Emma was alive. There, it talks more of the family secrets.</td><td>About Love and Relationships-the Harte Saga Continues On...</td><td>1150070400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2006-06-12</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jun</td><td>33</td><td>33</td><td>12</td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>33106</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1N04AOP70MISN</td><td>0002261367</td><td>DragonsChest</td><td>Nice storyline, I enjoy keeping up with the family goings on.

The concerned family solicitor calls in the renowned private detective Hercule Poirot.  A piece of wedding cake, an oil painting copied from a post card, and a Victorian bouquet of wax flowers are among the clues that set Poirot on the trail of the killer.

Alec & Peggy Legge was who my mind settled on close to the end.

She accordingly puts through a call to old friend Hercule Poirot, who drops in on the proceedings to discover that some one has turned the game into reality. DEAD MAN'S FOLLY is not among Christie's better known works, and in truth it does not rank among her great classics.  Even so, it has its charms, particularly in the form of Ariadne Oliver, a somewhat frazzled, absent-minded, and eccentric character clearly intended as a parody of mystery novelists in general and Christie herself in particular.  The novel itself is nicely written and offers Christie's usual clever twist at the end.

This is all to the good because Dame Agatha is the master of the country house with endless servants hovering about doing tiny tasks.  Her one nod to modern times is a shortage of gardeners. Crime writer Ariadne Oliver calls upon her friend, Hercule Poirot.  She has been hired to provide a Mystery Hunt at Sir George Stubbs' annual Fete.  She has a \"hunch\" that all is not well.  Ms. Oliver is prescient; her mock \"victim\" turns into a real one.  There is no shortage of suspects, but Poirot and the authorities are baffled. Ms. Christie rains clues as big as rocks along with her usual red herrings.  The problem for the astute reader is not who (though Ms. Christie conceals the murderer with her usual adroitness), but how and why.  \"Dead Man's Folly\" is a very busy book, and the scattered presence of Ariadne Oliver (one of my least favorite continuing characters) is perhaps one distraction too many. Subtract one star for overdone motivation, and another one-half for Ms. Oliver's constant dithering.

As usual, Dame Agatha has her way with us, sending us off in the wrong direction, maddeningly obscure clues, and a thoroughly suspicious bunch of characters. Roger Abernethie's heirs are gathered to hear the will when flighty sister Cora drops the bombshell, \"He Was murdered, wasn't he?\" The next day Cora is found axed to death in her little cottage. We have a raft of suspects and Ms. Christie is careful not to give any of them a satisfactory alibi. \"After the Funeral\" is vintage Christie.  She was at the height of her powers (1953).  The characterizations were surprisingly deft (usually not her strong suit.) Uncle Timothy, the malingerer, was overdone, but George, the clever ne'er do well had some great malicious lines.  She has a marvelous sketch of a private detective, Mr. Goby who was \"--small and spare and shrunken.  He had always been refreshingly nondescript in appearance and he was now so nondescript as practically not to be there at all.  Mr. Goby was not looking at Mr. Poirot because Mr. Goby never looked at anybody----he emphasized his last point by nodding significantly at the sofa.\" This slyly humorous well done mystery was a pleasure to read.

The family lawyer calls in Poirot, who functions late, but very effectively.  Clueing top-notch standard job, including two brilliant devices (the mirror and the wax flowers) dangled lovingly (yet tantalisingly out of reach) before the reader's very nose.

However, at the reading, Cora Abernethie Lansquenet, the late Richard's youngest sister, who's always been something of an embarrassment to the family, brightly blurts out, \"It's been hushed up very nicely, hasn't it... But he was murdered, wasn't he?\" When Cora is found dead the next day, Hercule Poirot has the task of finding the killer. After the Funeral was written in 1953 and is an homage to Abney Hall (Enderby Hall in the book), the Victorian mansion where the young Agatha Christie spent a lot of her Christmas Holidays. The setting is typically Christie: a Victorian mansion, colorful characters, a butler, a murder and of course Hercule Poirot. The narrative keeps the reader hooked and slowly builds up to the climax. The conclusion is -like always- surprising, but also rather fair. With an eye for the little details you should be able to find the killer. You might have a problem with finding the motive, but that is a small price to pay.

Ariadne is busy organizing a murder hunt as part of a big charity event being held on the grounds at Nasse House. It seems that she is not completely in charge of the script of the murder, because people are constantly giving suggestions and hints on where and how to plan this fake murder. Ariadne truly fears that she is being used to hide a real crime that is about to take place and calls upon her old friend Hercule Poirot to sort things out. The famous detective finds all of this a load of silliness, but nevertheless starts to get a little curious. Dead Man's Folly is a typical Agatha Christie mystery. The setting feels familiar, the characters are most of the time trying to deal with their past and the crime is as mysterious and complex as you can get. A generation conflict between the old folks and the teenagers is added to spice things up. As an extra bonus the reader is treated on a denouement is far from realistic, but is fair enough seen the number of hints you get throughout the story. The only problem that stops the reader from finding it out for himself is the enormous number of red herrings. Noteworthy is that Nasse House is based upon Agatha Christie's favorite residence: Greenway house, the Devonshire home Christie occupied during most of her married life. The character of Ariadne is a caricature of Agatha Christie herself.

Mystery novelist (and Christie alter ego) Ariadne Oliver has been hired to devise a murder mystery game for a village fete.  While she is on the scene setting up the clues she begins to feel uneasy about the whole thing, as she explains to her friend, Hercule Poirot she fears that her pretend murder may be replaced by a real one! Alas, even with two sleuths a murder does occur during the party.  Poirot rises to the challenge and uncovers the culprit in the end of course.  Along the way he deals with the various classes of village society, as well as a youth hostel full of foreign students and even a visiting long lost cousin. As always with Christie the clues are all fairly laid out for the reader to find, hidden among all the red herrings.  Her characters are consistent, and the solution is clever.  We are also treated to a delightful opening scene with Miss Lemon as an added bonus. This is one of Christie's later works (1956) and while she did try to keep up with the changing times she didn't have the same feel for the post war world as she did for the '20's and 30's.  Even so one of Christie's lesser works is still better than most writers can ever hope to achieve.</td><td>Some people take games far too seriously....</td><td>1084060800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2004-05-09</td><td>Sun </td><td>May</td><td>41</td><td>38</td><td>12</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td>61888</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Gary F.

The scenario concerns Roger Abernathe, an elderly man of tremendous wealth whose death comes not a moment too soon to benefit family interests. Brother Timothy and sister Cora are in reduced circumstances.  Nieces Susan and Rosamund have made questionable marriages and are in dire need of money to keep their husbands in line.  And what nephew George has been up to is positively criminal.  All in all, it is a classic Christie set-up--and an instance in which she cleverly uses the readers' expectations against them in the most unexpected way imaginable. Christie is not usually noted for her clever characterizations, but she peoples her novel with a host of memorable characters ranging from the elegant Helen Abernathe to the peculiar Mr. Goby to the dithering Miss Gilchrist, and her turn with celebrated detective Hercule Poriot is among the finest she wrote.  Compulsively readable and with a head-spinning solution, AFTER THE FUNERAL easily ranks with Christie's great murder mystery masterpieces, a meticulously crafted novel in which she invites you into her parlor--and distracts you with tea and crumpets to prevent you from noticing her truly wicked way with a web.

Christie shrewdly paints a portrait of two cousins of very different sorts, Susan Banks, the charming, shrewd, business type, and Rosamund Shane, the sultry, ditzy actress, and we watch the two of them square off regarding their men and in battle for a green malachite table from their Uncle Richard's estate.  Both girls are convinced that the table should rightfully belong to them. I enjoyed hearing Hercule Poirot compare the events of AFTER THE FUNERAL to those of LORD EDGWARE DIES, a long ago case of Poirot's from the 30s.  That clue should have given readers with long memories good reason to suspect that the solution of this case had something to do with a dazzling impersonation. The strange behavior of Gregory Banks, the nutty pharmacist husband of Susan, the man who brags about how he was stricken people down with his prescriptions, make you think almost immediately that he is the killer. Everyone's a wee bit suspicious but with Greg, Agatha Christie really lays it on thick. The best scenes are those with Susan, who could have been the heroine of a Christie play (in 1953, when this novel was written, Christie was square in the center of her theatrical triumphs).  Both the scenes at Cora's house when Miss Gilchrist receieves the mysterious slice of wedding cake, and then later on at Enderby Hall when Susan and Rosamund fight over the malachite table, could have jumped right out from one of the best 50s plays. Weren't you surprised to hear that in 1953, if you had two thousand pounds, you could buy a Vermeer?  Now the figure must be infinitesimally larger.  Perhaps 20,000,000 pounds? No longer do we have to read this novel under its ersatz American title, which always reminded me of a title by A A Fair--\"Funerals Are Fatal.\" All in all, a nail biting thrill ride of terror and chicanery.</td><td>All In The Family</td><td>1097107200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-10-07</td><td>Thu </td><td>Oct</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>338</td></tr><tr><td>61886</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A1N1YEMTI9DJ86</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Shirley Schwartz</td><td>This Poirot book is the usual fare for Christie fans.

From that simple beginning to the curious end, there are large number of characters with interesting stories of their own. The author has done an excellent job of creating the characters and in general bringing out the attitue of Englishmen towards foreigners. The story is interspersed with clues for the reader.

Christie delivers as she always has; the story is gripping, perplexing, witty, and charming. The premise is nothing new for Christie; most of her mysteries are domestic murders, where one of the household must have done it. This book follows the same pattern. What makes this story different and interesting is the Murder Hunt, organized by the character of Adriane Oliver. Since it will be obvious to the reader from the very beginning that Mrs Oliver is based on Christie herself, the whole Murder Hunt plays very effective mind tricks with him. It is as if the author has jumped into the mystery to give vital clues. The rest of the mystery is the typical blend of varied and fascinating characters, in a sprawling setting. The exotic foreigner, trophy wife, country squire, efficent secretary, all well-recognized mystery story hallmarks are present. Of particular interest is the character of Mrs Folliat, the old and mysterious ex-owner of the estate in which the story is set. As Hercule Poirot quickly divines, there's something about Mrs Folliat... The only problem with this book arises towards the end. With the exception of Oliver, Folliat and obviously the incomparable Poirot, the other characters are a shade disappointing. I have always appreciated Christie's shrewd analysis of the psyche of the domestic murderer. The reason why it is always near impossible to guess whodunnit is that the ruthlessness is always so neatly concealed within the character of the murderer. However, in this particular story, the characters are not as well-developed as they should be. They are interesting and plausible people, but rather simple. There is little of the shadowy bent of mind that makes them possible murderers. This leads to the actual solution sounding a tad contrived. A further disappointment is that the ending fails to tie up the Murder Hunt with the parallel tale of the actual murder. All along, the Murder Hunt has proven suggestible and exciting, but in the end nothing comes of it. Having said that, there is nothing seriously wrong with Dead Man's Folly. It possess all of Poirot's cunning and idiosyncratic charisma. And the true mark of the genius is that the reader will neither be able to guess at the solution before Christie herself decides to reveal it, nor will he be able to put the book down.</td><td>Mark of genius</td><td>1120780800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-08</td><td>Fri </td><td>Jul</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>17</td><td>408</td></tr><tr><td>61871</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2Y1SCM930PZI7</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Jabberwocky</td><td>This is easily the worst mystery I've read from Dame Agatha.

The plot revolves around the death of the wealthy Richard Abernethie, a death that no one though was particularly suspicious until Richard's somewhat dotty sister, Cora blurts out the question at the funeral, \"It was murder, wasn't it?\" This is a Poirot mystery and I remember when I read it the first time I was completely confident that I knew who the murdered was, only to find out at the end of the book that Christie had led me down the garden path by cleverly planting false clues, and I was completely wrong about who the murderer was. The best thing is, she had made those false clues so subtle, so unobvious, while at the same time planting other extremely obvious clothes toward yet another suspect. Here I had been patting myself on the back for not following the red herring and figuring out who the real killer, and instead I had fallen for a second, more subtle red herring. Several years later I read the book again, and I'll be darned if I didn't fall for the exact same trap the second time I read it. That is how much of a genius Agatha Christie was in developing her plot. She could lay false leads upon false leads and make it so subtle that the reader is convinced that s/he's out thought the author. So this is my favorite Christie book.

Incidentally, if the members of the Abernethy family hadn't been so self-conscious of their belonging to their social class, there wouldn't have been any mystery at all.

Her legendary Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot used his shrewd logic to defeat many criminals when microscopes and labs were used in other mysteries, taking the reader on a rid of their life as he tracked clues and interviewed the suspects. When Richard Abernethie dies and his family meets at the funeral, one person is certain that he was murdered. But when Cora, the one who knew something falls to the same fate as her brother, fingers start to point and everyone is in shambles unable to produce a clear alibi. Nieces and nephews, the servants and even strangers who were at the wrong place at the wrong time seem to hide something and it's not too soon when the famous Poirot, disguised as potential buyer of the Abernethie mansion is called to sort out the mess.  \"After the funeral\" was a complex and delightful read because it wasn't as simple as most books, this tale had so many guilty suspects that the hard part was weeding out the only one person responsible for the death while omitting more than a few red herrings and characters of mixed morals. Poirot outdoes himself relying heavily on his use of conversation, talking about nothing and everything to catch a phrase out of context and secure his bait. I adored the wide array of characters, the feuding family, snobby and marred with flaws as they made for a colorful read with one of the best twisted endings I have ever read. The story itself was simple yet it spiraled into a huge event, one that I loved sitting and reading for a few days, and always trying to find more time to devote to it.

First, as the title suggests, the story only begins after the funeral of a wealthy man.  When the relatives gather at the house afterwards, his sister blurts out that he must have been murdered even though he was known to be terminally ill and no foul play was suspected.  When that same sister is brutally murdered the very next day, however, there can be little doubt that something sinister is afoot and this is where Hercule Poirot is called upon.  Still, we don't see as much of him as we usually do.  The suspects are scattered about England and a number of the interrogations are conducted by other people and reported back to Poirot.  In the end, of course, Poirot gathers all the interested parties together and reveals the solution. Normally, I find that any Poirot novel suffers greatly when the Belgian is used sparingly.  So I was pleasantly surprised in this instance that the other characters were sufficiently interesting to carry the load.  The cast is pretty varied and I definitely found it interesting to see how they interacted with each other in the aftermath of these murders.  The story generally moves along at a good pace though it slowed down a touch toward the end.  The razor sharp humor that Poirot provides when portrayed at his best is largely absent here but the book doesn't suffer too badly. This is nowhere near the best Hercule Poirot novel but it certainly is a solid effort.

In this book, one \"murder\" is committed, then a second, then another person is poisoned and a fourth is \"coshed\" on the head.

Not only is the mystery intricate, with many clues and red herrings, her style of writing is mesmerizing -- extensive vocabulary, bits of philosophy, charming settings and social interactions, cozy and comfortable.

Unfortunately, she has a premonition that something awful is going to happen, and begs her friend Hercule Poirot to come to Nasse House at once. Although at first reluctant: Poirot does agree to come, and soon the pair are embroiled in a real-life mystery involving a possible kidnapping and multiple murder. The finale of this complicated little puzzle is well up to the Christie standard, but (like \"HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK\") the solution is too abruptly given and one or two key bits of information is kept secret from the reader until after Poirot has announced the killer's identity. And even though the scene of the novel is based upon Agatha's own fondness for Greenway House (the country estate she would later come to own): the various subplots feel tacked on, and the richness of the minor characters and suspects are sadly lacking in any charm or depth. As a result of the botched writing job: \"DEAD MAN'S FOLLY\" ends up on the list of \"so-so\" books within the Christie canon even though it had the potential to be a really good, first-class thriller. However, there is one striking feature that I must point out: the character of Mrs. Folliat (the former owner of Nasse House). She is without question one of Christie's finest creations, and a personality who seems to understand the truth behind the murders yet is hesitant to tell Poirot what all she knows.

I enjoyed it immensely. And for that, I high-handedly believed that it was just luck - a one-hit wonder, so to speak. (I find that keeping a healthy dose of pessimism is sometimes advisable so as to make my enjoyment of the same author's other work more rewarding.) And really, After the Funeral is a mystery that latches onto you a few paragraphs in from the first page. Latches on and refuses to let go. The sudden death of the head of the family, Richard Abernethie, has forced the rest of the brood to come together in the hopes of receiving good news of being left a huge chunk of the inheritance. It was only later after the reading of the will that one of the more cuckoo characters, Cora Lansquenet, makes a slip of the tongue and exclaims, \"But he was murdered, wasn't he?\" One more turn of events and then the story begins to unfold in an unhurried, but unmistakably steady pace. The arrival of the estimable Hercule Poirot certainly upped the stakes, making it clear to the reader that Christie has taken the gloves off. Now the hunt begins. The bevy of characters and their respective something-is-not-quite-right veneer keeps the reader on tenterhooks as to who might have done the deed. Snatches of well-placed hints about an object or an unrelenting memory from a past conversation all have the indubitable signature of this renowned crime-detective author. This is certainly a novel that proves the adage, You think you know...but you really have no idea... When Poirot was in the stage of giving his `speech' revealing who the culprit was, I still thought that I may have a handle as to who it could be...and so I was complacent. But the revelation was such that I literally had to straighten up. I was like, \"Eh, wha--? Huh?\" After that, I had not choice but to (again!) bow at this wicked talent of Christie.

Dead Man's Folly had all the makings of a fantastic Agatha Christie novel. Unfortunately, while the story was very well done, the mystery itself left much to be desired. I enjoy the mysteries that showcase Ariadne Oliver. I love the character, who seems very much to be a caricature of Agatha Christie herself. Her calling for Poirot to help her prevent a murder that hasn't happened yet set the stage for a wealth of possibilities. And Dead Man's Folly made great use of the investigative collaboration. The problem with Dead Man's Folly, and it's a huge one, was the ending. Agatha Christie usually gives us the clues, lets us figure out who we think is the murderer, and then shows us how naive we really are in the end. While there were clues in Dead Man's Folly, all were basically pointless. The killer, while being a complete surprise, came out of nowhere. No one could have figured it out, as it seemed to be a case of picking a random character at the last minute and creating evidence to make it all seem plausible. A wonderful premise, but a lackluster ending.</td><td>Reading with Tequila</td><td>1290297600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2010-11-21</td><td>Sun </td><td>Nov</td><td>39</td><td>39</td><td>36</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>61823</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A1G37DFO8MQW0M</td><td>0006162754</td><td>C.

It is one of the best Agatha Christie novels I have read in which the famous Hercule Poirot the Belgian detective aids in the solving of a troubling family murder mystery.   The novel opens following the funeral of the wealthy Mr. Richard Abernethie. He is the owner and is the busy CEO of a family industrial firm. During the meal following the funeral obesquies the sister of Richard whose name is Cora Lasquenet blurts out that the dead man was murdered. Later the next day she herself is beaten to death with several blows of a heavy ax.   The suspects are fascinating characters: Helen Abernethie the widowed wife of Leo Abernethie who has been living abroad for many years prior to her visit to Enderby. Timothy and Maude Abernethie the brother and sister in law of Richard. He is in poor health being nursed by his stout wife who mothers him with care. Susan and Gregory Banks-Susan is the smart niece of Timothy. Gregory her husband is a chemist who has been in a mental rest home. Rosemary. and Michael Shane-Another niece of Richard Abernethie. She and her husband are in show business. Michael is unfaithful to his wife. Rosemary is a scatterbrained chatterbox who enjoys shopping. Mr. Entwhistle-The longtime family lawyer for the Abernethie family. He is a friend of Poirot and brings the little Belgian into the proceedings. He could have stepped out of the pages of Dickens! George Crossfield the ne'er do well nephew of Ricahrd Abernethie. He has huge gambling debts. Alexander Guthrie is an art critic. He was a friend of the late Cora Lansquenet. Miss Gilchrist is the companion of the late Cora. She once owned a tea shop but has become impoverished during the war.   The case includes strange nuns; poison wedding cake and arsenic poisoning. This reviewer was flumoxxed as to who the real murderer was; only Poirot and his genius can solve the crime.   This is a thinking person's murder mystery which is a fun read and a marvelous page turner. Match clues with Poirot and see if you can discover the foul murderer.

Only one aspect of _After the Funeral_ deserves high praise: the plot and denouement are clever -- so clever and memorable, in fact, that it's difficult to try and enjoy reading this book for a second time (as I tried), because apart from the clever plot, there is not much to enjoy here, unfortunately. And that is very much unlike in Agatha Christie's finest novels, which *are* re-readable because their only value isn't in the whodunnit. Ms. Christie must have been in a very gloomy mood when writing _After the Funeral_. In fact, the title says it all, about the novel's atmosphere. This is a post-World War II novel, and everyone seems dejected. There is an unpleasant air of plaintive nostalgia permeating the novel; incessant complaints (from *many* different characters) about how the world is deteriorating. In fact, you can't help feeling, while reading this novel, that it must have been written by an author who herself wasn't among the youngest. (Christie was 62.) And that is, of course, always a bad sign. Although the novel attempts to depict young characters, the prose isn't youthful at all, and the attempts at humour are rather strained. Agatha Christie's idealism seems to have vanished. In Christie's best books from the 30s and 40s, there were always at least a few characters depicted in a positive manner who helped retain the reader's interest. Here in _After the Funeral_, all the characters are disagreeable, unpleasant, and/or silly persons; the *only* person depicted more kindly than not, is Helen -- symptomatically, one of the oldest characters in the cast. Poirot is portrayed rather perfunctorily as well (only appearing for the first time 28% into the book); not much wisdom or many witty observations coming from him here. In short, _After the Funeral_ seems to me to indicate a decline in the quality of Christie's writing; it unpleasantly reminded me of such utter failures among Christie's late novels as _Third Girl_ and _Elephants Can Remember_; while those two are execrable and next to unreadable, _After the Funeral_ at least definitely is readable; it just seems to signal that the author is \"over the hill\" now, and that is always sad to realize.</td><td>Many Detestable Characters = Decreased Book Quality</td><td>1294272000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2011-01-06</td><td>Thu </td><td>Jan</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>38</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td>61821</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AISUSPFYY68RO</td><td>0006162754</td><td>bookworm1858</td><td>After the Funeral by Agatha Christie Black Dog & Leventhal, 1953 303 pages Mystery; Poirot 4/5 stars Source: Library Summary: After the funeral of Richard Abernethie, his sister Cora posits the theory that he had been murdered, causing a ripple of shock throughout the gathered family.  The next day Cora is found, having definitely been murdered with a hatchet.  Presumably the same person did it but who can solve the mystery? Well the famous Hercule Poirot can! Thoughts: What a puzzler!  The final conclusion was so startling and I kind of wonder if it could have been solved.  I really feel like one of the major clues was based on intimate knowledge of the characters' looks and mannerisms which it is difficult to gain merely through reading.  I had high hopes that I could solve the mystery since there were only about six possibilities for the murderer, by my count, but of course I didn't because of that pretty big twist. There is not very much Poirot in the story.  Consequently I did not feel that he was very annoying.  He hardly spoke in his annoying French italicized words and he was often background as the Abernethie family spoke over him.  Indeed the bias of Britons against foreigners is seen in their reaction to the strange \"Frenchman\" (he is of course Belgian.) One especially interesting aspect was the historical context provided.  Despite the year (1953), it seems like wartime rationing was still not over [eggs] which is difficult for me to comprehend as that year is among America's brightest.  The lack of quality servants is also bemoaned; additionally one character's hopes of running a tea shop was ruined by the onset of war.  The tragedy of WWII kind of hangs over the entire story in a very interesting way. Overall: Average-not too much Poirot but the mystery was really interesting.

In my opinion, AFTER THE FUNERAL ranks in the top FIVE. In fact, after MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, it's my favorite. The villain/villains (?) (may be a man, may be a woman, may be both) is/are one of Christie's most delightful & original characters. The plot has everything Christie: Old mansion, quirky family heirs all looking suspiciously at one another, beautiful ladies & men who live way beyond their means & are desperate for their inheritance (deserved or otherwise), well-timed murders--and the REALLY quirky & fastidious Hercule Poirot. It is also filled with AC's very modern sense of humor. Yes, this one is DEFINITELY a keeper.

Although she was still easily capable of writing a fast-paced, well-plotted mystery, I would rank this book well below the best novels from her prime.  Poirot enters this book relatively late, but the mystery is satisfying and the clues are there to be seen -- by readers sharper than I am! The country house setting and mostly upper-class suspects fit the usual model of a Christie mystery.  But, unfortunately, the times leave their mark on this book.  During Christie's prime from the mid-1920s through the end of World War II, the British Empire was still intact and whatever hard times some people in England were suffering through, Christie's characters sailed through life in characteristically British style.  By the early 1950s, much in England had changed.  Gone, for the most part, are characters connected with the Empire -- none appears in this book -- and food shortages and high taxes have become an important topic of conversation.  In fact, the ravages of high taxes are mentioned so often in Christie's postwar books that it's pretty clear she must have personally felt their bite. So, at least for me, while the mystery itself is fine, the atmosphere is significantly different from what you find in the classic Christie mysteries of earlier years.  If, like me, you have already read most Christie mysteries, you will find this one to be quite enjoyable.  If, on the other hand, you are new to Christie, a better place to start would be \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" or \"The A.B.C. Murders.\"  You should note that this book was also published under the title \"Funerals Are Fatal\" -- I made the mistake a few years ago of buying a Christie that I already owned under another title.

When I'm in the mood for a mystery novel, I find that I can never go wrong by choosing an Agatha Christie, and Hercule Poirot is generally my detective of choice (though I have enjoyed some Miss Marple mysteries, too). It is rare that I can ever guess who the culprit is, though I came oh-so-close this time, changing my mind towards the end thanks to Christie trying to throw us off the scent. Christie's key clues to solving her mysteries are almost always so subtle that I tend to miss most of them. Naturally, Poirot doesn't miss even the tiniest detail before stunning the gathered \"suspects\" with his (in this story) unsuspected brilliance. Not only can she map out a great \"whodunnit?\" story, but Christie also throws in quite a bit of humor in the process, which makes for a fun read. Sure, the victim was bludgeoned with a hatchet -- rather gory stuff -- but you can't help but laugh out loud at the quirky characters in the story, most especially the victim herself. I was rather sorry that she didn't get to stick around the entire time, I can only imagine what else she would have said (in addition to the teaser I posted on Tuesday). You can always count on Poirot to be an amusing character, a bit foppish, arrogant (but rightfully so), and seemingly dimwitted when he wants to go unnoticed. Overall, I very much enjoyed After The Funeral. It didn't blow me away like some of Christie's other mysteries, but it is a solid story that provided much entertainment.

The riddle is solved.\" And he did it not knowing anything more than you do as a reader. That's what makes Agatha Christie so interesting, I think. Her mysteries are sometimes awfully challenging to solve, but they are possible to solve.  You don't need any scientific, medical or any particular specialized knowledge to be able to point an accusing finger at some character and be fairly confident that your suppositions will be borne out by Monsieur Poirot (or by Miss Marple) in the end. At one point in this book Poirot mentions something that someone said, but shouldn't have said. \"That was stupid of her, wasn't it?\" asked Rosamond Shane, a niece to one of the deceased characters herein. Poirot shook a forefinger at her. \"It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversation. It is a profound belief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject whatever, sooner or later they will give themselves away.\" And in this book it was something one person said which could not possibly be true and once you realize that, that this person is the murderer, the explanation of the crime falls rather easily into place.  Of course, if you miss this one sentence then you will find yourself in big trouble as to who did what to whom.  Of course Poirot, unlike readers such as myself sometimes, never misses anything. Thus, near the end of this book Poirot has wrapped up everything very nicely: \"Let me, first, go over the various points which were brought to my attention by the excellent Mr. Entwhistle. First, Mr. Richard Abernethie dies suddenly. Secondly, after his funeral, his sister Cora Lansquenet says, \"He was murdered, wasn't he?\" Thirdly Mrs. Lansquenet is killed. The question is, are those three things part of a sequence? All I can tell you, the prospective reader, is yes and no, and suggest that you read this enjoyable Agatha Christie book yourself!

While Poirot knows whodunit for some pages before the reveal, I also figured out whodunit at the same time he did. It helped that I had a day to think all the clues over. I was tickled that I got the whole sequence right, including motives. I love it when the clues are all there, but the answer isn't immediately obvious. We didn't get to know any of the characters very well, but they were interesting and had varied personalities. The details about the setting and time period were minimal but interesting. There was a very minor amount of bad language. There was no sex or gore.

But one does not know what to look for. And so one looks in the wrong places or for the wrong things.  So intones, Hercule Poirot in Agatha Christie's mystery Dead Man's Folly. Merriam-Webster Dictionaries  defines a folly as \"a very unusual or fancy building that was built in a garden for decoration or amusement in the past\"  and one of these plays a central part in this mystery. Another definition would  be \"a foolish act or idea.\"  Example herein, as illustrated by the character Alec Legge: \"Do you know what I should like to see done in this country?\" \"I should like to see every feeble-minded person put out---right out! Don't let them breed. If, for one generation, only the intelligent were allowed to breed, think what the result would be!\" \"A very large increase of patients in the psychiatric wards, perhaps,\" said Poirot drily. \"One needs roots as well as flowers on a plant, Mr. Legge.  However large and beautiful the flowers, if the earthy roots are destroyed there will be no more flowers.\" Asides such as this (notwithstanding it being a clue too) make Agatha Christie interesting to read and I am glad she has so many works worth reading (including this one).  In this book a mystery writer plays host for a staged fake murder mystery hunt on the grounds of a posh estate. The character, Ariadne Oliver, is most unlike Agatha Christie herself, thankfully, and comes across as a personality who writes popular mysteries and is more interesting than the books she has written; almost the opposite of Miss Christie, herself.  Hence this line herein, from Mrs. Oliver to Christie's Poirot: \"I can't imagine why everybody is always so keen for authors to talk about writing. I should have thought it was an author's business to write, not talk.\"</td><td>Poirot on others: \"[O]ne does not know what to look for.

I did identify which bits of information were important and I had some ideas about what each clue could mean, but none of my guesses were exactly right. Still, it's possible someone could guess it.

Soon the character who utters this pronouncement is herself murdered, and (to borrow the phrase) the game's afoot! This Poirot novel pits the Belgian sleuth against a puzzle of one mysterious death after another, and no shortage of suspects, all potential murderers. Readers are given a glimpse into the detectives thoughts as he pries into the case with his accustomed tricks. The delight of revisiting our old friend is matched only by the feel of the time period: set in the aftermath of WWII, the feel of an England still recovering is prevalent and palpable. Christie always knows how to set a scene, create unique and realistic characters, and this is no exception. The book is also a meditation on the fact that any of the characters harbors within them the potential to murder. This serves to imbue the most casual details with menace since the reader will not know where it make lead.</td><td>Christie gets the best of me once again!</td><td>1398556800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-04-27</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>75</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>61729</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A34HYLJOZHVHR3</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Dottie Serio</td><td>I love the Hercule Poirot series and this one did not disappoint.

Callahan</td><td>This is one of Agatha Christie's larger and more complex efforts.  The array of suspects includes at least eight or ten characters.  The murders are linked to a large inheritance.  Many of Christie's suspects are very disgusting or insipid.  These include the hypochondriac Timothy with his continual whining about his health; George who pretends to be an investor, but is really just a compulsive gambler;  and Michael, who pretends to be a good husband, but is really a serial philanderer.  Seldom in Christie do we encounter so many unpleasant characters, or such a tangled web of clues and suspicions. We suspect that many of the heirs will go through their large inheritance very rapidly.  Michael and Rosamond will finance very bad plays, pursuing their egotistical dream of becoming theatrical greats.  George is already in deep debt to casinos, and will fritter away the rest of his inheritance at the dice table. Hercule Poirot explains that in this case physical evidence is not to be found, so he must approach the mystery by analysis of those characters who had opportunity and motive.  The characters come to life through dialog -- pages and pages of it.  The novel involves a series of set scenes with all the suspects given free rein to ramble on and on.  Poirot says that, given enough aimless conversation, the killer will unwittingly reveal himself.  So it proves in this case. Ms. Christie is a master of settings.  We have the manor house, which figures several times.  There's a lawyer's office where several scenes take place, a few posh London apartments, and a rustic little cottage in a small village. The novel was great fun.  Agatha again contrasts the dignified and \"classy\" world of the old money and aristocracy against the grifters and opportunists that appear to be taking over English society.  A case of the fine old gentry being displaced by very shallow, venal descendents.  Such is the tension in a number of her novels.  The old butler is a kind of choral character.  He has seen the old and the new, the best and the worst -- the old world in collision with the new.  That old butler is a fine \"foil\" expressing Agatha's own point of view. I liked it.  Buy it.

There are a lot of people involved in the planning of this fete (which is basically a village carnival), so there are many things going on all at the same time and a variety of relationships making themselves known between people, as Poirot makes his observations. The story has a bit of a house party feel, with all the people and visitors to the house.

I had read this book many years ago and had completely forgotten the culprit and the idiosyncrasies of Hercule Poirot.  Hercule makes use of his little gray cells to solve the mystery in classic Christie fashion albeit too late to prevent a few murders. Hercule Poirot is summoned by his friend, mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, to put at ease her discomforting feeling that somehow she was being manipulated in the planning of her murder hunt for a wealthy country squire.  The mystery hunt was to be a combination treasure hunt/scavenger hunt with the winner finding clues and eventually solving the murder and winning a prize.  However, after the contest has barely begun, an actual murder identical to the fictional murder takes place.  Hercule has only been on the scene a short time, but immediately sets to work to try to find the killer.  To complicate things, on the same day as the murder, the country squires wife goes missing.  Now, Hercule has two mysteries to solve.  After a couple of days, Hercule must return home without success. A couple of months later Hercule is still puzzled by these two mysterious events and his lack of success.  He returns to the country squires home in an attempt to ferret out more information.  He realizes he has been led astray very cleverly by the killer and now begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  He soon solves the mystery in his mind, but lacks proof.  He contacts the local authorities and they begin searching for evidence of foul play, which they find. This story reminded me of the genius of Agatha Christie with her use of subtle hints that can be easily missed if the reader isn't paying attention.  The expert use of the red herring to mislead readers is also evident in this work.  There is some swearing and a derogatory term used in the story just to let readers know.  I based my rating on the ability of the author to tell a good mystery.</td><td>Dead Man's Folly</td><td>1407110400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-08-04</td><td>Mon </td><td>Aug</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>87</td><td>362</td></tr><tr><td>61697</td><td>3.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A1UEGBAHUQSSCE</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Khirul</td><td>While generally engaging and satisfying, this is one of the works in which Christie's strong plotting is marred by her occasional tendency to make things needlessly complicated, as well as by her excessive tolerance for greed in the upper class.

Since I loved her very revealing autobiography, I'm fascinated by her spoof of herself in the character of mystery writer Ariadne Oliver.  The introduction of the daffy-but-shrewd Mrs. Oliver not only gave Christie a chance to poke fun at her own eccentricities (real and rumored) but also to make life hell for her brilliant, irritating detective - the egomaniacal Hercule Poirot. As for the plot, well it's a mystery, isn't it?  Somebody gets murdered and the detective has to figure out who-dun-it and the other characters have to throw in as many monkey wrenches as they can to make sure that the crime isn't solved until the end of the book. Although I think Christie's stories were well and intelligently plotted, I read them for their charm and their realistic characters. Of course, you can argue that the bluff, good-natured country squire and the self-absorbed beauty and the acidulous spinster and the grand lady of the manor are stereotypes, but don't be surprised if old Agatha pulls the rug out from under you.  Some of these folks are NOT what they seem! My only criticism is that (in my opinion) one of the main characters would NOT have gone along with the charade, but the author would counter that she HAS to or there will be no book.  Irrefutable logic.  I'm also intrigued by  Miss Brewis - the hyper-efficient secretary who's in love with her boss and has a very poor opinion of his lovely, scatty wife.  After the author's death, her widower married his long-time, devoted  secretary. Coincidence or Dame Agatha getting in a sly dig at her husband?

An unusual call from Miss Ariadne Oliver the crime novelist who bears a distinct resemblance to her creator Dame Agatha Christie (1890-1976), Ariadne asks Poirot to leave his luxurious London digs. Poirot arrives at Nasse House. The estate of sixty-five acres in owned by Sir George Stubbs. Stubbs is oafish but wealthy. He is married to the fetching but stupid Lady Hatite Stubs. Oliver wants Poirot  to judge the winner of a contest to determine the fake murderer in a murder hunt game. A young girl Marilyn Tucker is acting as if she has been strangled to death in a boathouse near the lake. What occurs is that Marilyn is actually murdered! Meanwhile, Lady Stubbs disappeared. Later still an old man who works at the ferry is found dead. It later turns out that he too was murdered.   The book is well written and it is easy to sort out the suspects. The least likely person in the novel turns out to be the real murderer with an associate also involved in a murder   The book was first published in 1956. It was filmed in 1986 with Peter Ustinov playing Poirot and Jean Stapleton doing a turn as Ariadne Oliver. A recent Masterpiece Mystery production starred David Suchet.  This would be a good book for someone new to the works of Agatha Christie to get their feet wet. Be warned, though, that once you become a fan of Dame Agatha you will stick with her through many wonderful novels.

You probably puzzled it all out within the first fifteen minutes, while I had to wait until the very end of Dead Man's Folly to discover who was the real killer. Once again Agatha Christie takes her audience on a roller coaster ride of red herrings, peculiar characters, and mysterious clues. Ariadne Oliver, who is one of my favorite recurring characters, has been asked to write a game that resembles a murder mystery party. Oliver feels as if she's being played or steered when the players start suggesting changes to her story.  So she does the only practical thing she can do--she calls Poirot. While her game is being played, two things happen: 1. A murder. 2. The disappearance of Lady Hattie Stubbs. And of course, Poirot is on the case! This is an intriguing story with a few plot twists that kept me guessing. I really had no idea who the murder was, or what the motive was until Christie laid it all out at the end. I tried to use my 'detective skills' from watching Poirot and Marple on the small screen. But alas, nothing. I love the way Christie writes such diverse characters. All of them with a plausible motive. I can't compare this to other Hercule Poirot books that Christie has written. as this is my first, but I would like to say: Well done, Christie! There's a reason why Christie is known as the Queen of Mystery, and this book is a clear example as to why.</td><td>Fantastic!</td><td>1409529600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-01</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>102</td><td>298</td></tr><tr><td>61669</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A2IEEN02KO9ISO</td><td>0006162754</td><td>lighthouse88</td><td>An older gentleman dies suddenly, leaving his fortune to be divided amongst his relatives.  After his funeral, his family is gathered together when his sister blurts out that she thinks her brother was murdered.  No one takes her seriously it seems until she is murdered the very next day.  The lawyer in charge of the brothers estate begins to investigate on his own, but soon realizes he is out of his element.  He contacts his old friend, Hercule Poirot, to help discover if, in fact, his client was murdered and who murdered his sister. He inserts himself into the family and has trouble eliminating any of the other family members as suspects.  It appears no one has a verifiable alibi.  As Poirot continues to question the family, he begins to make the killer more nervous, making a mistake that allows Poirot to narrow the field.  The family dynamics and the different characters make the plot interesting with plenty of red herrings to keep readers guessing. This story was just a great whodunit!  I had read the story many years ago and when I read it again, I enjoyed it just as much the second time.  I didn't figure out the murderer the first time or the second time, but was completely involved in the story and was sorry to see it end.  The characters are quintessentially British and Hercule Poirot is at his finest.  The plot is interesting and will keep readers tuned in from beginning to end.  This is one Agatha Christie mystery readers will not want to miss.  I hope in the future to re-read other of these wonderful classic mysteries and post my reviews here.</td><td>After the Wilderness</td><td>1409529600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-01</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>103</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td>61670</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AKYZ3ZGKG5K9D</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Funny</td><td>There is absolutely no one like Agatha  Christie!!!

Mr. Abernethie ran a successful family business and with the death of only son occurring years earlier, the heirs to the family money include Richard's hypochondriac brother Timothy, his sister Cora, whom no one has seen in twenty years after she married a man considered 'unsuitable', nieces Susan, a businesswoman, Rosamund, an actress, and nephew George, in finance. At the home after the funeral, Cora carelessly tosses off a comment about Richard being murdered. Most of the family chalked it up to Cora just stirring up the pot, as she is won't to do. But the next day, Cora is brutally murdered in her home, and now Mr. Entwhistle is concerned that perhaps Richard was murdered. He goes to Hercule Poirot to investigate and find out if Richard was murdered and who killed Cora. I found it amusing when Poirot turns to Mr. Goby, a man \"famous for the acquiring of information.\" Goby calls government snooping \"God's gift to investigators.\" Given what we know about the NSA, one could infer that government's spying on their citizens is a time- honored practice. The family members all have money issues: Timothy hasn't worked due to his \"illnesses\", and his house and car are falling apart. Susan wishes to buy a pharmacy for her husband. Rosamund wants to use the money to support her and her husband's dreams of staging a play. George apparently has a gambling problem and has been using clients' funds to cover his losses. They all have motives for wanting the money, and Poirot discovers that many of them had opportunity as well. It's great fun following the clues and trying to put the puzzle pieces together to discover the murderer. (I confess that I was wrong.) It's interesting that Poirot does not dominate the story. He comes into the story late and stays in the background for the most part. In today's mystery/thriller series books, the protagonist (a cop, investigator, medical examiner) tends to dominate the stories of the books, with the crime relegated to equal or lesser plotlines. I also found it interesting the lengths that people will go to when money is involved. Like government spying, greed appears to be something that has been with humans for a long time, and probably will be for a long time to come. Now that I have read three Agatha Christie novels, two of them featuring M. Poirot, I'm curious to read Sophie Hannah's take on the iconic character in The Monogram Murders.</td><td>A standout Agatha Christie novel</td><td>1410134400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-08</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>105</td><td>436</td></tr><tr><td>61643</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A39529JJJEEDP5</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Whistlers Mom</td><td>I'm a confirmed Miss Marple fan  myself, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy watching Hercule Poirot pull a rabbit out of a hat.  Although no spring chicken, he does a fine job here, especially considering that he isn't even called into the case until Chapter 7. The back story is a bit complicated, involving the large family of a prosperous Victorian manufacturer.  The Man-Who-Made-The-Money is long since gone and so are most of his children.  Then the remaining ones start dying off - some suspiciously, some violently.  Looks like one of the younger generation may be clearing the deck for a large inheritance.  But which one?  The stuffy old family lawyer tries some detective work on his own, with predictable results.  Finally (in Chapter 7) he calls in the heavy artillery - his old friend the semi-retired M. Poirot. Poirot in turn calls on HIS semi-retired buddy - the wonderful Mr. Goby.  Mr. Goby's business is to collect information and there's not much he can't find out.  He has a great deal to say about the younger generation and the advantages and disadvantages of Big Brother governments.  He speaks exclusively to various pieces of furniture and is one of my favorite Christie characters. The setting is post-WWII England and the older folks are grumbling about high taxes and labor unions and the lack of proper servants.  The younger folks are choosing mates and pursuing careers and trying to get what they can out of their older relatives, while avoiding them like the plague.  I especially enjoyed the two female cousins - two young women who seem as unlike as night and day and yet who have very similar attitudes toward their men. Poirot carefully, tirelessly shifts through the alibis and the motives and listens to all the people involved because he knows that eventually we ALL reveal ourselves in our conversation. In the end, it boils down to one thing.  If no one is watching you, you can get away with murder.</td><td>The advantage of being invisible</td><td>1410393600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-11</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>106</td><td>347</td></tr><tr><td>61644</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1UTEVCX14LK2B</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Book Ensz</td><td>Another engaging masterpiece.</td><td>Great read</td><td>1410393600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-11</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>107</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>61642</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1N0TSO5L4IF9G</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>A very good book.

After the Funeral takes place as the title suggests: after the funeral. When Cora attends her brother's funeral, at the reception she casually mentions he might have been murdered. Though many of her family members write her off as a nutter, the family solicitor can't help but make his own inquiries. Then the unthinkable happens--Cora is murdered! There's nothing left to do except seek the help of the great Hercule Poirot. This is one of those mystery novels where the entire cast of characters has many motives to commit the crime, but you have absolutely no idea who the killer could be. So it wasn't till the end when Poirot lays out evidence that it all comes together.

That's probably why I can read it so fast. When I was 12, my mother tried to get me in the habit of reading a book before I went to bed. I'm not sure why. I've been a bookworm since I could read, so I certainly didn't need any encouragement. I enjoyed TV mysteries and Nancy Drew, so someone - I don't know who - suggested Agatha Christie. I got three omnibus volumes of Christie - one Poirot, one Miss Marple, and one mixed (including the dreadful Tommy and Tuppence - yuck!). In the Poirot volume was \"Dead Man's Folly.\" I have loved it ever since. Hercule Poirot receives a phone call from his friend, Ariadne Oliver, a mystery novelist. Something is up, but she can't or won't explain. He just has to come down to Nasse House in Nassecombe. Worried that something serious is wrong, Poirot heads for Nassecombe, a picturesque English village. Nasse House was formerly home of the Foliots, but the family has died out and the house is now the property of the nouveau riche Sir George Stubbs and his apparently dim-witted, though beautiful, wife, Hattie. There is to be a fete (a type of festival or fair) and Mrs Oliver is in charge of planning the Murder Hunt - which is the problem. Mrs Oliver has the sense that someone is manipulating her somehow, though she is not sure who exactly is responsible. Poirot trusts Mrs Oliver's intuition. And I know what you always say or look about intuition. [Mrs Oliver] One calls things by different names, said Poirot. I am quite ready to believe that you have noticed something, or heard something, that has definitely aroused in you anxiety. I think it is possible that you yourself may not even know just what it is that you have seen or noticed or heard. You are aware only of the result. If I may so put it, you do not know what it is that you know. You may label that intuition if you like. Poirot stays on, ostensibly to hand out prizes, but in actuality to do some detecting. How can he detect a crime that hasn't been committed? While the everything appears to be going well and people are enjoying themselves, there is a murder - of the girl playing the victim in the Murder Hunt. Her death is not the first and it will not be the last. I love it when Christie sets her mysteries in English villages. She does a lovely job of bringing the world to life, even while it was actually dying out. Another good portrayal of this is in \"The Body in the Library,\" where murder strikes close to Miss Marple's home. If you've never read a Christie, this is a good one to start with. It's fun, easy to read, and makes you want to reread it so you can see what you missed the first time through. That's unusual - I've read quite a few mysteries where I had no intention of ever rereading them. This is not one of those. Highly recommended.</td><td>One of my favorite Christies</td><td>1413244800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-10-14</td><td>Tue </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>126</td><td>524</td></tr><tr><td>61594</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2U8WSU5VSMYHC</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Ms. Yow</td><td>Classic Agatha Christie!

The book is hardback, approximately A4 size and runs to 46 pages. The illustrator, Marek, has interpreted Christie's slightly caricatured cast of characters well and has also brought out some of the humour and lightness of tone that always makes her books a joy. Dead Man's Folly features Poirot and his novelist friend Ariadne Oliver investigating the death of a young girl murdered during a village fte. The plot is easy to follow in this format, though as to be expected much of the investigation is very abridged. This may act as a good introduction for older children to Christie's works, and I'm sure would also be an interesting curiosity for established fans.

Bledsoe</td><td>I was in the proper mood for an Agatha Christie mystery when I sat down to read \"Dead Man's Folly.\" I was thrilled to note how skillfully she used dialog to rapidly sketch out characters. During the opening pages she clearly invents the concept of the murder-mystery party, which has been a popular entertainment for some decades since. All good. Poirot is swept aside as the police investigate the murder of a young girl. As this investigation continues to plot and feel to the story flattens. Pages turn and that sense of why I read Agatha Christie melts away. Yet I am patient as I read. At last Poirot re-enters the story. He is puzzled too, which is good because I wouldnt want to it be too easy. At last the solution dawns on Poirot. In the final scene Poirot confronts not the culprits, but oddly enough one of the peripheral characters and lays out the truth. But the truth as he reveals the details could not possibly have been the result of the workings of the little grey cells. The resolution as it stands must have come from routine investigation and not of inspiration. When Poirot would have had time to do this investigation is the greater mystery. Somehow he just knows these things. As I read I turn the page and Voila! I am faced with a blank page and must conclude that the last words written were the last words of the story. Most unsatisfactory. Clearly this solution is not the result of Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation would not have been the most entertaining, but the solution provided strains believability.

If the prosecutors could simply point out that Gary Murphy knowlingly disguised himself on a daily basis to be \"Mr. Chips,\" then they could have shown that Soneji was not a schizophrenic.  Being a \"nice\" schoolteacher took enormous effort on the part of either Murphy or Soneji - thus, pre-meditation for crime was apparent at this stage.  Teachers at Washington Day describe \"Murphy\" as likable - it couldn't have been \"Murphy,\" ever, teaching school.  Murphy would have wondered what the hell he was doing in a classroom, in DC, in a wig.  He never did.  Therefore, the whole ploy was impossible from the get-go.  Luckily, Patterson was able to distract us with burning crosses and other sub-themes so that we readers would gloss over the weakness of any schizophrenia defense.  At least we can take comfort in the wise decision of the jury; for they saw through the weak defense argument.</td><td>There seems to be some enormous holes in the plot.</td><td>898560000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>1998-06-23</td><td>Tue </td><td>Jun</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>73842</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A109B0SCCCM7BM</td><td>0006476155</td><td>tsimpson@energyintel.com</td><td>I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end!

A brilliant African American detective with a higher moral agenda than your average suspense novel protagonist.  In Along Came a Spider we  are introduced to Patterson's seamless blending of first and third person  narrative that works so well with a many faceted character such as Alex  Cross.  This book succeeds on many levels: as the villian Gary Soneji is  trully vile but not unbelievably so, the supporting characters such as  Alex's family are made interesting and revelant to the story, and it  progresses quickly with twists and turns that lead to a surprisingly  emotional ending. Along Came a Spider has a little of everything: criminal  psychology, courtroom drama, love, murder, kidnapping, insightful family  interaction, and the kitchen sink!

I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross.  (I hate to read a series out of order, even if the stories are independent and  don't continue from book to book.)  Along Came A Spider is a perfect  \"fun\" read.  It moves at a very rapid pace.  (The chapters are  usually just a few pages.)  It has pretty well developed characters  considering its quick pace and more plot twists than you'll ever  anticipate.  Just when the romance element in the book started to bore me  Patterson turns it on its ear.  Another thing that makes this book so good  is that despite the surprising plot twists everything is fairly believable  within the context of the story.  I read a lot of mystery/suspense and one  of my biggest complaints is that I'll get really into a book and the climax  will be totally ridiculous.  You know, the killer will turn out to be the  sister of the girl that was accidentally drown in the rich family's pool  the night of the prom thirty-five years before but nobody recognizes her  because she's a master of disguise or whatever!

I will just say that  this novel was like reading two different novels.  One was a very  intelligent suspenseful mystery about a kidnapping carried out to go right  where the Lindbergh kidnapping went wrong.  The scenes of Alex Cross trying  to find Gary Soneji, the court scenes, and the conversations between Cross  and Gary Murphy are wonderful. This part of the novel gets 5 stars. However,I subtract two stars for the unbelievably boring and uninspired  romantic twist to the story, there was a point where I just decided to skip  whole chapters that didn't add anything to the story.  I got through the  first three hundred pages faster than I did the last two hundred.  It was  just mesmerizing to think that the same brilliant mind that came up with  the suspenseful mystery came up with the other garbage.  Don't get me wrong  I do enjoy romance in a mystery novel, in fact I think its an important  part but Patterson should ask Jeffery Deaver, who writes so well about the  relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, or maybe ask Ridley  Pearson, who does so well with Lou Boldt and Daphne Mathews, to give him a  few tips on mixing romance with suspense. My reccommendation is read this  novel but if the mood starts getting romantic don't waste your time, at  least not until the end where the romantic scene is important. Alex Cross is  a great character and Gary Soneji is the perfect nemesis, I just feel that  Patterson did a better job of mixing his romantic chapters with the story  in Cat and Mouse than what he was able to accomplish in this novel.</td><td>Good  suspense, but unbelievably boring romantic scenes!</td><td>966470400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2000-08-17</td><td>Thu </td><td>Aug</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>73813</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3Q330VXNDI9K3</td><td>0006476155</td><td>michael luciano</td><td>Do yourself a favor and read this book.

Almost jumping off the pages and into your nightmares is what James Patterson manages to succeed in doing to you.  Here is fair warning: IF you have a penchant for dreaming about the books you read, you may want to avoid Patterson's books at all costs!  His characters are SO BAD they almost defy the words in the English language to fully describe. Gary Soneji is also one thing many serial killers are not: He is VERY smart (maybe not smart enough NOT to kill, but pretty darned intelligent) but he is also hopelessly past all ability to rehabilitate, too.  Patterson's pace is so fast that there is practically a new chapter on every-other-page.  The pacing is like a semi coming down a steep grade with no brakes.  Watch OUT!

McGuire</td><td>Having read everything by Michael Conelly and Jeffrey Deaver, I was looking for a master of suspense with an imaginative and intellectual lead character. I found both with James Patterson's Along Came A Spider and Dr. Alex Cross. Alex Cross is a lead detective with the Washington Police Department. He is also a very able licensed psychologist. While investigating a series of murders he is called out to take the lead in the investigation of the kidnapping of a politician's son and a movie star's daughter (Maggie Rose).  It isn't long before he finds out the murderer and the kidnapper are one in the same. The manhunt for Gary Sonjei and the search for little lost Maggie Rose have Cross teamed up with the FBI and the Secret Service. Sonjei proves to be evil incarnate with a master plan and a high I.Q.  The plot thickens and surprises abound, keeping interest at a high level throughout the book. Patterson delivers what every suspense reader wants.... a vulnerable and loveable good guy along with a bad guy that has you afraid to turn out the lights at night.

I didn't have to worry about a slow or annoying plot in Along Came A Spider because it moved very quickly.  Patterson did a great job of moving the characters right inot the feel of the novel.  The characters were superb.  There were many instances in which I felt like I was Detective Cross and my decisions would determine the outcome of sticky situations.  Along Came a Spider was able to grab my attention and hold it.  After the first couple of pages, I soon found myself unable to put the novel down at time that I knew I should have.  Along Came A Spider truly impressed me to the fact that I can not wait to finish reading Patterson's next thriller, Kiss the Girls.

I have read all of them three or four times each by now..they really are that addictive.  Alex Cross, the fictional love-of-my-life, is a tough, detective/psychologist in the Southeast side of Washington D.C.  Alex has a wonderful family and best friend Sampson (who I always imagine as a Forrest Whittaker type) who help him get through his daily doses of crime and maiming.  Let's talk about the story...it was a normal day at the Washington Day school, until two students, Maggie Rose Dunne, and Michael \"Shrimpie\" Goldberg are kidnapped. Their favorite math teacher, Gary Soneji takes them, burries them in the ground and demands a huge ransom.  These two students were children of the most prominent families in the area.  Alex and Sampson are taken off a brutal crime in the D.C. area and forced onto the Goldberg-Dunne kidnappings.  Everyone gets involved.  Secret Service, FBI, and the Washington police all try to work together to solve the crime.  This book has so many twist and turns, and plots within plots, it will make your head spin.  Every page you turn reveals something new and exciting.  Even when Gary Soneji is caught....nobody is sure who is responsible...Gary seems to have a split personality (Remember Adam Stampler from \"Primal Fear\") and the outcome of his trial is questionable.  You have to read this book...Alex Cross books like this one, and \"Kiss the Girls\" are movies now, but they never let you see Alex in an intimate way.... he has a loveable family, his best pal Sampson, and lots of juicy romances.  All of these are left out of the movies.  Why? because Patterson wants you to see the movie...love it...and then read the books..because he KNOWS you too will like it better than the movies and read the whole series.  I promise, the books are really are not comparable to the movies.</td><td>Oh Alex!

I hate that. Dr./Detective Alex Cross, a Washington DC forensic psychologist/gumshoe and his partner, John Sampson, are assigned to investigate a double kidnapping with the FBI and Secret Service. The victims are Michael and Maggie, the former the young son of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and the latter the young daughter of a movie star. Very early on, the reader knows the identity of the perp, a brilliant serial killer named Gary Soneji, and Michael's fate. As Gary continues his murderous swathe across the landscape, all wonder. How do we catch this guy, and where's Maggie? The best thing about this thriller is Cross, a world-weary widower who loves his kids and his grandmother, and who's not afraid to be, in the honorable tradition of Eastwood's Dirty Harry, a thorn in the side of his boss and the mayor. You gotta love the guy. Also, the Maggie character was endearing, but author James Patterson gave her too little press time. The main problem with the book is that, at 502 pages in paperback, it's about 50 too long. By the novel's end, Gary's essential evilness and the de rigueur plot twist have been diluted out by an overabundance of other bad guys and the relationship between Cross and Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan, which Patterson develops ad nauseam. Moreover, for the apparent sake of maintaining the potential for a series, a major thread is left hanging. It's as if the author, or his editor, didn't know when to quit. Less would have been better. The movie version of ALONG CAME A SPIDER was recently released, starring Morgan Freeman. From the trailers I've seen, the film adaptation seems to be a different story entirely. (Gee, what a surprise!) Besides the opportunity to observe the great actor Freeman, I'll want to see if the output of some Tinseltown scriptwriter can force both my thumbs in the same direction.

Everyone involved does a great job; Morgan Freeman plays Alex Cross with extreme emotion, Monica Potter is decent as secret agent Jezzie Flannagan, and Micheal Wincott is perfect as psycho-kidnapper Gary Soneji.

I was so disappointed when they cast Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross.  Alex in the book is MUCH younger.  There are so many aspects of Alex's life and character that were left out to accommodate the elderly movie Alex -- such as Alex's children, grandmother, relationship with a character in the book, etc... (don't want to give too much away - *wink*) That was a HUGE turn off to me when the movie came out.  Because this is my favorite book, I do not want to draw comparisons between the book and movie.

The kidnapper attempts to recreate The Crime of the Century(Charles Lindeburgh), by kidnapping the daughter of a senator. The senator is not a very prominent one at his postion, so this move baffles detetives on how he plans to create the crime of the century with just a senators daughter.

The year started out with the amazing Sean Penn film starring Jack Nicholson \"The Pledge\". It was then followed by Ridley Scott's sequel to \"The Silence Of The Lambs\", \"Hannibal\". We then had Robert DeNiro and Ed Burns star in \"15 Minutes\" now along comes \"Along Came A Spider\", which might not be as good as \"The Pledge\" and\\or \"Hannibal\", but it does prove to be a very entertaining film. It's a movie that's filled with lots of twist and turns and we go along with them, loving it! Back in 1997 we were first introduced to the character created in James Patterson's novel and the film version of \"Kiss The Girls\". Morgan Freeman under the direction of Lee Tamahori gives a wonderful performance. Freeman is an actor that truly has a presence that dominates on screen, no matter whom he's acting against. And that presence is very clear to see in this movie. The film opens up with a very exciting scene showing Freeman and his partner in action going after some rapist (I think). Right from that very first scene the viewer knows that they're in for a very suspenseful,exciting, and entertaining ride! A senator's daughter has been kidnapped dispite efforts by Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) who seems to work well in her scenes with Freeman. Flannigan (Potter) has been watching Megan (The senator's daughter) for 3 years. And can't believe how they're suspect Soneji (Michael Wincott) could have escaped. After a phone call from Soneji himself, sorta requesting that Detective Alex Cross (Freeman) take on this case, we are set to believe that for the rest of the movie Soneji is our man. But, the screenplay by Marc Moss has something else up it's sleeve. A major twist happens that sets us in a completely new direction. If someone can actually tell me that they saw what was going to happen in the end, then I must be the biggest moron walking around. Because I was shocked! If it wasn't for the plot twist, I don't think I would be recommending this movie. A lot of critics are complainng that the movie has too many plot holes. To them I say...LOSEN UP!!!! I've yet to actually see that is without any doubt absolutely perfect. The movie is entertaining. It keeps our attention, and has an ending no one will see coming. It's enjoyable, and exciting and I think people will like it for what it is, and will have a good time watching it.</td><td>A \"Spider's\" web of twist and turns!</td><td>987206400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-04-14</td><td>Sat </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>35</td><td>430</td></tr><tr><td>73764</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A2GHZVX5RY6DTC</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Some dorm buddies and I were bored last weekend, so we decided to go see something. It just happened that the \"something\" was this ridiculous waste of time and Morgan Freeman's acting ability (which should be a crime). I never read the book, as I am not a Patterson fan, so I can't compare the two. All I know is... After the very cliched prologue (i.e. the part that has nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the movie), the movie doesn't deviate from the cheap-o thriller rut. Freeman does what he can with the painfully bad dialogue, but to no avail. This was so predictable I found myself doing a mental checklist of coming events (killer calls NOW!....check.....twist comes NOW!....check). The worst part is the so-called, much-hyped twist. A good mystery gives you suspects and clues to foreshadow twists (Usual Suspects, 6th Sense), but this is one of those cheating movies that throws a totally unexpected twist that is, at first, shocking. After thinking briefly about the twist, one realizes that there IS NO WAY TO SEE IT COMING. The writer just decided \"hey this is suprising\" and threw it in, depite the fact that it makes NO SENSE. Plot holes are common, but what if the entire plot is a gaping wound bleeding ineptitude?</td><td>Atrocious</td><td>987897600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-04-22</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>36</td><td>217</td></tr><tr><td>73763</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1YYDSYUCHX5HJ</td><td>0006476155</td><td>William H.

Patterson has given us a hero with flaws, a wonderful family and personal relationship with his friends, a man with moral conviction and a fierce determination to bring criminals to justice. \"Along Came a Spider\" is the first in the series and it is a whopper of a tale.  We meet the extremely heinous Gary Soneji, a murderer, a kidnaper, who seemingly can't make any mistakes.  He kidnaps the children of a prominent politician and a movie star, and then proceeds to feign his crimes under the \"multiple personality\" umbrella.  What a sickie! What makes Patterson so great is that he weaves tales with brisk, short chapters; characters that have more than one dimension, and a wonderful sense of timing.  He pulls lots of plot twists, not quite as sinuously as Jeffrey Deaver, but still they are lulus!  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying these books.  They are the creme de la creme of the lot! Enjoy, but be prepared to get hooked. One aside:  I agree that the casting of Morgan Freeman as Cross in the two films is questionable.  Freeman is a marvelous actor, but I think casting a younger actor, such as Denzel Washington or even Cuba Gooding, Jr., would have allowed the movies to follow the books' characterization more fully.  But don't blame Freeman.  He does an outstanding job, as always.

The villian in the novel is intelligent, cunning, and very dangerous, and so the hero in return must also be intelligent, and insightful.  Patterson succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat through out much of the book, and I found most of his twists, and turns very entertaining.  Sadly what I did not find entertaining, intelligent, or even fresh was the routine use of the \"Black vs White\" mentality used by the star of the book Alex Cross.  I found the use of this really insulting, and it turned me off almost to the point of putting the book down. I could not understand why its inclusion made this a better book, or a better character.  I certainly hope that in the future Alex cross books, that Patterson was comfortable with himself as a writer that he no longer had to include such petty plot devices.</td><td>Excellent book despite...</td><td>988329600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-04-27</td><td>Fri </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>39</td><td>171</td></tr><tr><td>73750</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A168V1U6RUWH3K</td><td>0006476155</td><td>grubniffer</td><td>Alex Cross is such a likable character - exciting in his official capacity - touching as a father.

First I want to give this book 3 stars but since I start to read his second Alex Cross novel 'Kiss the girls' I found that James Patteson is one of the greatest mystery novelist. The plot is good and reasonable, it has unexpected twists but in the middle of the book after kidnaping, it seemed as Patterson didn't know how to continue the idea he has started with. So there is like 100 an plus pages you can easily skip, but the ending is unexpected and really surprising. It's just somehow irritating as suspense novel is everything but taut in the place where you want to let your dog starve for a day and your finacee is waiting for a ball game just for you, but you are in your own universe.  The serial kidnaper is an intelegent person and so the hero needs to be, so this is a good premise which run well in the novel. As it's his first novel, you can see that character of Alex Cross isn't build-up very well yet, so sometimes the hero reacts or behave in out-of-logic manner and in some parts of the book he's not so belivable. Story is well buid, there is enough of suspense and unusual twists.

Not a truly original plot to begin with, but Patterson turns what you think is boilerplate into a tale containing enough twists to keep you turning pages well into the night!  When the kidnapper is thwarted by an accidental death, and the $10,000,000 ransom is never recovered even when the perpetrator is caught, the story begins to turn into a wonderful thriller that keeps the reader clueless until far into the book, something not many authors can achieve.  Is our criminal suffering from multi-personality disorder or is he an actor worthy of an Oscar?  Where is the surviving kidnap victim?  Has love found Alex Cross?  Is the FBI baffled or merely inept?  Why are the authorities so nonchalent?  After they have the kidnapper in custody, why don't they ask \"where is the child\"?  Has Alex Cross been taken in by a cunning, conniving con artist?  I won't tell you, but you must find out for yourself.  Any true mystery fan owes it to himself to read this book.  Are you the sleuth you think you are?  Find out for yourself.  If you weren't hooked on Patterson prior to \"Along Came a Spider\" you will be after you've read it.  Oh!

One of the great things about this series and Along Came a Spider in particular is the complexity of the story line and the substance of the characters. Unlike most other crime/thrillers this one has a main character with values. I don't know how many times I have read a story about the main character having an afair or doing something immoral. Alex Cross is as true as they come. His family life is nicely depicted  along with his friendship with his partner. Alex Cross is such a complete character its hard to believe he isn't a real person.

Who is the bad guy?  Will Alex lose this partner in his attempt to locate the Senators lost daughter? Who will die and who will survive? Alex Cross is in a race with time, and he does battle with the unique mind of a serial killer as well as a set of bad guys that comes as a surprise in the end.  Be ready to begin reading and not stop until you have reached the end.  I highly recommend this book.</td><td>A taut thriller say the author of $oft Money</td><td>991094400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-05-29</td><td>Tue </td><td>May</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>47</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>73714</td><td>3.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>AZB2XL16IA1XA</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>an unassuming way to spend a couple of hours - but don't expect much more.  good for a date, because there will be some moments when you cling - but not so many that you won't have time to get replenishment refreshments. i can't quite figure out why this film doesn't work.  it starts off with a good beginning that is supposed to explain why alex cross (morgan freeman) is so disaffected towards his work.  problem is that you just don't believe it.  i'm not sure if this is because of bad acting (which is uncharasteric of freeman's work), bad writing (the likely culprit) or weak directing (clearly a strong assist).  in any case, all it takes for dr. cross to get back into the swing of things is a call from a psycho kidnapper.  hey, if we only know... the plot holes grow from there.  frankly, i didn't really care.  partially because i wasn't all that engaged, partially because i wasn't expecting that much.  pacing of the film is uneven with some parts getting pretty dull.  the ending is ludicrous - you could count the plot flaws, inconsistencies, and holes, but you'd quickly run out of fingers.  the most annoying part is the barnaby jones approach.

They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me.  It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity. The scenes are also dull and choppy.  I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere. I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author.  I am glad I borrowed them from the library!

That film featured him playing as Alex Cross, a detective solving a mystery with enough plot twists to keep things interesting throughout.  It wasn't the best movie ever made.  It wasn't the best movie in the thriller/mystery genre.  But it was fun to watch more than once.  And that's what I can say about \"Along Came a Spider.\" The movie begins with Alex Cross losing a partner.  One might say it was his fault.  He feels that way, at any rate.  And so he goes into a slump where he just sits around building ships.  This is the character development that sets things up for the rest of the movie.  But that opening scene rather fails, mostly because--and this is going to sound stupid, but it's true--the special effects are so achingly bad.  If they release a 'look how we did this' feature on the DVD, people will say, \"Uh, it was OBVIOUS how you did that.\" And yes, that's a bad thing.  At any rate, it gets things going. Once the ball is rolling, the audience watches as a little girl is kidnapped by a criminal who craves fame.  To get that fame, he drags the reluctant but famous Alex Cross into the scene.  And so Morgan Freeman gets to show that he's very good at this kind of role.  He's on the case, accompanied by Monica Potter.  And though lots of people thought she did a terrible job in this flick, I thought she did wonderfully. As the hypothetical member in the audience watches, the movie takes him or her through a number of intriguing plot twists.  This just wouldn't be a movie about the Alex Cross character without those.  And the plot twists are very cool.  They mess around with your head, which I rather like.  However, some of them felt hollow simply because after they happen, you sit there and go, \"Yeah, that's nice, but as I viewer it would have been nice if I were privy to that information.\" In other words, you're stunned simply because you didn't know how some things functioned. The real thrill doesn't come from fearing who will die next--this is seldom a problem, except where the little girl is involved--but in seeing how Alex Cross attempts to outwit the deadly mind behind this whole affair. So what it comes down to is this: if you enjoyed the basic setup in \"Kiss the Girls\" (that is, mystery, plot twists, light action from time to time), you're going to think that this is just as good, if not better.  If, however, you like tons of explosions and a lot of action, pass on this one.  It's a great movie, certainly, but nothing you can feel good about unabashedly recommending to every last friend you have.</td><td>Great but not ground-breaking</td><td>994636800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-07-09</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>52</td><td>505</td></tr><tr><td>73701</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>APR3XUARXTZV6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Terre</td><td>Like all the James Patterson Books, and the Alex Cross books in particular, you are drawn into the story from the very start.

I seriously read the last 150 pages in a blur, I don't think I even took a bathroom break.

Why, oh why, would a producer pay big bucks to a best-selling author for the rights to film his book, only to twist the plot into unintelligibility? James Patterson, author of the eponymous book, is perhaps the most uneven writer working today, but Along Came a Spider (the first book to introduce Detective Alex Cross) was a superb thriller--unquestionably one of his best. Why screenwriter Marc Moss and director Lee Tamahori tried to improve Patterson's story is beyond me. Frankly the plot twists they added simply don't make sense. This is the kind of film you enjoy while you are watching it, then within an hour or less you start questioning why things happened as they did. I'll not spoil the suspense for those interested by enumerating these details, but even the strength of the book's characters get the Hollywood treatment. The brilliant villain Gary Soneji is rather sidelined in the film, while Patterson liked him so much he brought him back in another Alex Cross book. The cast are the saving grace of the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job reprising his role as Alex Cross. Although in Kiss the Girls I thought he was rather too old for Cross (and he's certainly no younger now!) he seemed more convincing to me in Spider--perhaps I'm simply detaching his portrayal from my mental image. Monica Potter, as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan, bears a resemblance to a younger Julia Roberts and sounds uncannily like her. Michael Wincott, as Soneji, was fantastically evil, the highlight of the film. I look forward to seeing much more of him. Some final thoughts: the opening scene has some of the least convincing computer generated images seen onscreen in ages. This certainly isn't a reason to miss the film--the scene is almost entirely incidental to the rest of the movie (and not even in the book at al) and if you come in 5 minutes late you miss nothing--but I have to wonder why more care wasn't taken. And the musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the Hollywood giants, is not his best work by far. The music of the closing credits worked well, but there was a curious mis-match between music and scene in most of the film. Finally, in the opening credits the vowels drop down into the actor's names on CGI spiderwebs--a single textured filament, like a spider descending on its thread. I have to admit to almost laughing out loud at what was obviously supposed to be dramatic, but when the capital \"A\" dropped down I couldn't help but think it looked like a zipper... All in all, it's worth waiting for this one on network TV.</td><td>Arachnophobia</td><td>999388800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-09-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>60</td><td>469</td></tr><tr><td>73683</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ABIT7MDWKONPK</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Ryan</td><td>This is the first and what I think is the best Alex Cross novel.

I did not see the movie, but had envisioned Denzel Washington to play the smooth and sophiscated Alex Cross and was disappointed in the choice of Morgan Freeman.  But after reading this book, Morgan Freeman fits Alex Cross in this book perfectly - for this book only!!! I love Patterson's books and have read just about all of them.  I find them to be engrossing, suspenseful and I just can't put them down.  He foils me with the ending each and every time!! In this book, Patterson has a serial killer at large, Gary Soneji, who has kidnapped two children, and who wants to be known as somebody. Jezzie Flannagan from the FBI, is also on the case, giving Cross support to capture the killer.  Three great strong main characters, exposed to the reader so as to get into their psyche, yet intertwined with each other to make for one incredible story.

Litton</td><td>If you happen to be a fan of \"Kiss the Girls,\" the 1997 surprise hit thriller, then you may be a bit disappointed in its prequel, \"Along Came a Spider,\" which pits Dr. Alex Cross against yet another kidnapper who has an agenda to be dealt with. As Dr. Cross, Morgan Freeman makes the film watchable at best, but the ominous presence of loopholes, twisted logic, and the overall way in which the movie toys with the audience, results in slight disappointment. The movie opens with a chase sequence that serves little purpose other than to set up a time of emotional turmoil in Cross's life, after the death of his partner as a result of this pursuit. His personal war against himself is put on hold when he discovers that a young girl, the daughter of a Senator, has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper wants Cross on the case. Teaming up with Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), who was the child's guardian at the private school she attended, the two of them begin sorting through the clues and details involving the kidnapping, trying to get a lock down on the whereabouts of the teacher they believe responsible. To say that the movie makes a mistake by revealing the kidnapper's identity is a misfire, but the fact that we know who he is doesn't enhance the plot, either. The movie is a sea of loopholes, from the solving of clues to the realization that the kidnapper may not be working alone. Consider a scene in which Cross goes through computer video in order to find a clue to the villain's whereabouts. He goes from searching through a classroom to a live computer camera that is based in the kidnapper's apartment, without any logical explanation for this transition other than a mere piece of dialogue from an extra to explain that what he is looking at is no longer recorded video. In another scene, Cross has a conversation with the kidnapper about a ransom exchange that took place in an earlier sequence on a subway train. The amount of the money was a mere ten million dollars, but Cross congratulates him for his retrieval of twelve million. This is one of the movie's more admirable twists, letting us in on the fact that since our villain seems to know nothing of this ransom, then there must be someone else involved. There are plot points that work, and those that don't, and in the end, the movie has toyed with us a little too much. \"Kiss the Girls\" toyed with our expectations, too, but allowed us time to build our own conclusion before throwing it back at us, all the while keeping our interest peaked. \"Spider\" toys with us in ways that leave little time to draw any sort of conclusion about what is going on, leading up to a particularly effective surprise twist ending that doesn't cheat according to the rules the plot has set up, though is somewhat hindered by the heightened disinterest in the lead-up. It's good to see Morgan Freeman back in such fine form; as Dr. Alex Cross, this is the Freeman we all know and love. His ability to instill calm in the most tense of situations is remarkable, and his solving of the crimes is shown in an intelligent, capable light. I will refrain from commenting on the acting of Monica Potter, so as not to reveal what happens, but I gather that the audience will make their own decision about her acting in the beginning and the end once the ending arrives. Michael Wincott is an ideal villain, and however little of him we get to see, his performance is remarkably chilling. In the end, \"Along Came a Spider\" is worth it for Morgan Freeman's acting, and some key plot points, but the overall effect the movie has is disappointing. The plot twists of the movie feel more like obstacles than advancements, while the central mystery never reaches a fully interesting fever pitch until the end. There are things that work and things that don't in this film; unfortunately, they never reach a healthy medium.</td><td>This spider's web is too sticky.</td><td>1001462400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-09-26</td><td>Wed </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>65</td><td>693</td></tr><tr><td>73663</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Michael Crane</td><td>I probably would've enjoyed this movie a lot more if I had seen it before reading the book.  Most of the time, that is the really big disadvantage of reading the book before seeing the movie.  \"Along Came a Spider\" was an okay movie, but it could've been a lot better. When a insane lunatic decides that he wants to be famous, he kidnaps a daughter of a senator.  After that, he contacts Alex Cross, and invites him to join his little game.  After trying to get away from the detective life after he had lost his partner, Cross knows he's back in the game, and that he may be the only hope the little girl has.  As he goes through a series of clues, Alex Cross realizes that the man who kidnapped the girl does not want money, he wants fame.  He wants to commit the crime of the century.  Now, Alex has to find out what exactly the kidnapper plans before it's too late. The book was a lot more suspenseful and thrilling than the movie.  The book was also a lot more sick and disturbing.  The kidnapper played by Michael Wincott, (who is also the bad guy in \"The Crow\", and \"Metro), should've been more dangerous and psychotic, just like he is in the book.  In fact, if you read the book and picture Wincott as the kidnapper, it will send chills down your spine.  There were a lot of great things that happened in the book that don't even appear in the movie!  The very beginning of the movie seems very phony and fake; you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  The DVD should've had more special features as well.  The only ones I could find were the theatrical trailer and a documentary on the making of the movie. Is this movie suspenseful?  Does it have some startling twists?  Does this movie keep you on the edge of your seat?  Yes, it does all of that, but not as well as the book does.  If you're more into movies than books, then see it.  If you like books better, read the book instead.

The scene caught my attention and my interest, but as the story steadily moved towards the ending, i began to feel that i have seen these scenes before. the ending is not really that shocking partly because Potter didn't act very well in this film (under-acting, as opposed to over-acting, kills some performances). And it's this kind of movie that shows whether an actor/actress is really all they're made out to be. When an actor (morgan freeman) stars in a lackluster film and is still a good actor, then that is a trademark of greatness. the other actors/ actresses do a fair job, but the kidnapper needs special mention because he does an excellent job, very convincing. I liked Kiss the Girls, perhaps because Ashley Judd is a much better actress than Potter is, but also perhaps because the story was more solid. While this film is attempting to shock us and throw a twist at every scene, it fails to really make us care about any of the characters. Now that ive said all that, I must say that this movie's first act (you'll know what i mean when you see it) is much better than its second act. if the movie would've maybe stuck a little closer to the nature of the 1st act then i would've given this film 4 stars - but instead the film drivels off into cliched territory where i don't really care what happens next. Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors alive right now, he has incredible timing, ive never seen him over-act or go out of character. He can literally play any part (he's even played a bad guy, such as nurse betty or hard rain). however, even freeman can't save this movie from mediocricy, but he does make this movie a worthwhile rental...</td><td>caught in a spider's web...</td><td>1003536000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-10-20</td><td>Sat </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>75</td><td>313</td></tr><tr><td>73649</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AXA7OH47LBXZ7</td><td>0006476155</td><td>A Positive Guy</td><td>This is a movie that started out with a good, but predictable plot and somewhere around the middle grabs you and doesn't let you go until the last minute of the movie.

Morgan Freeman is great (as usual), but the newcomer, Monica Potter who plays the part of a secret service agent is superb in this role.

She did a really good job; I was impressed. Morgan Freeman plays the same great-souled, moderated, contemplative, world-wearied guy he always plays. He needs a good badguy role; a real SOB role where he blows up a lot of stuff. Monica Potter is atrociously boring as the Secret Service sidekick. Her tepid performance is indistinct to that of her 'Patch Adams' character, which was a mind-bogglingly bad movie on so many levels. In 'Spider,' she tags along and whines with all the emotive ability of a seventh-grader. The badguy/kidnapper had the potential to be interesting; diabolical even. This would have made the twist even more compelling. However, his motivation is never explored beyond the *he's playing a game, and he's very methodical* schtick. I must say that the twist is really well-done, if kind of ridiculous. They didn't have to make the movie totally incomprehensible to pull it off. However, they didn't leave enough time in the movie to really get into the depths and motivations behind the twist, but by that point I was ready for the whole thing to end.</td><td>Bland & monotonous; good twist, though</td><td>1003622400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-10-21</td><td>Sun </td><td>Oct</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>77</td><td>214</td></tr><tr><td>73647</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A160AB64G2E949</td><td>0006476155</td><td>B.

I got interested in Patterson after I read and saw \"Kiss the Girls.\" I read ACAS and was totally amazed. It was one of the best books from a new author that I'd read in a long time. The novel begins with a serial killer kidnapping two children from an exclusive private school where he teaches. Detective Alex Cross is hired to find the missing kids. This being the first Alex Cross novel, Patterson portrays him amazingly. Cross is the most intelligent, noble, and kind man that has ever existed in fiction. No matter what Alex Cross book you're reading, even if the plot is horrible, you'll enjoy the book just because Cross is in it. He brings so much to the novel, with his excellent detective and psychologist skills to the love he openly shows for his partner, his grandmother, and his two young children - the latter of the three being the most admirable. Reading scenes between Cross and his children is just so touching...or maybe I'm just being too much of a girl. :) Anyway, back to the novel. In the infinite world of psychos in novels, Patterson knows how to creep us out. Gary Soneji, the killer in ACAS, is a frightening and disturbing character that adds all the suspense needed for the novel. He is a smart killer obsessed with committing the crime of the century. \"Along Came a Spider\" will send chills through the reader's body and keep their eyes open, alert and glued to each page until all hours of the morning. It is solid, compelling psychological thriller.</td><td>And along came James Patterson...</td><td>1005782400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-11-15</td><td>Thu </td><td>Nov</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>79</td><td>311</td></tr><tr><td>73643</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24DBUIAWDQXA2</td><td>0006476155</td><td>S.

Customer</td><td>This book was a slam dunk.  I am glad it was the first Patterson (featuring Cross) book that I read because it set up a lot of things that might have seemed odd or inconsequential later.  Now that I have read all the books in the series, I rank this one and KISS THE GIRLS as his two best. Much has already been said by others ... about the thrilling plot, the surprises and etc., so I will focus on two aspects of the book that have remained with me long after reading.  The first is the deft insertion of social commentary in the book.  When I first read the book, I thought James Patterson was African American, and I mean that as a compliment.  He became Alex Cross, and Alex Cross is a black man with real life black man problems aside from solving serial killings.  His family is authentic; his associations with black and white people; his romances (with white and black women) without being condescending, cute, or stereotypical--I should maybe write more about this category it was handled so well without making Cross a whitegirl chasing Tom, despite his affair with Jezzie, good job, good job, good Job Mr. Patterson; his reluctance to be pulled off a case involving working class blacks to solve one involving elite whites.  In short, his attitudes about things is not typically black, but typically Alex Cross, who happens to be black.  Get it?  He is real first.  And he is black second. The second aspect that burns long after consumption is Soneji/Murphy as a husband and father in suburbia.  There is humor, humanity, and lurking danger in these scenes.  I kept praying that when he finally snapped--which I suspected was coming and boy was I right--that he wouldn't hurt his daughter.  Patterson pulls no punches, and reading these scenes I began to buy why a man with such a regular looking life (dull normal life) might secretly be a serial killer.  Just looking for fun.  OK, that's sort of a simplistic assesment of Soneji/Murphy's particular psychosis, and to understand him better, we would probably have to consider what we know about his Freudian footnoted childhood on his grandfather's farm and whatnot.  Nevertheless, Soneji/Murphy is scary BECAUSE he is looking for fun, on some level.</td><td>Just Looking for Some Fun</td><td>1008374400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-12-15</td><td>Sat </td><td>Dec</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>84</td><td>399</td></tr><tr><td>73638</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A127PCLKOSDS04</td><td>0006476155</td><td>J.

This film however struggles to make a lot of sense, and limps along despite him being in the starring role. It is set in a sort of phantasy world of super criminals and heroic police. A senators daughter is kidnapped by someone who has devoted most of his life to working up to this crime. He is not interested in a ransom but rather in being respected by the Freeman character. All simply nonsense of course. Again the villian seems to have worked as a teacher for some years, not a high paying job but one that has allowed him to collect such assets that he can hide out in boats and mystery houses. It also strains credability that he has been a teacher for over a year wearing a rubber face mask. One should not give away the plot developments of the second half of the film, but in reality they stretch what is believable to the point that a film which starts out as fantasy moves into another dimension of hyper fantasy. The difficulty with such films is that as they become so contrived they lose the ability to manipulate the audience. A flim works if you feel for the victims, if the villians appear original or grab your imagination, if the main characters seem to do something right. In this film the villian appears to be a moron, the victim precocious and the solving of the crime artificial. An okay way to fill in a couple of hours but a film that is pretty much forgetable except for the dumb bits which stay with you for weeks after.</td><td>Contrived</td><td>1011398400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-01-19</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jan</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>86</td><td>287</td></tr><tr><td>73597</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AJDYDG7YZY9QL</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Stephen A. Haines</td><td>\"Detective\" films can be traps for the unwary.  A particular role can overwhelm the story, or the story can be so convoluted as to leave the actors no room to maneuver.  Spider comes closer to the second option.  The film's plot concerns the kidnapping of a Senator's daughter from a high tone prep school.  There are Secret Service types all over the place [including one in background reading a magazine, which is hilarious in itself], and the one in charge, Monica Potter, roundly berates herself for failing to prevent the snatch.  The kidnapper, who's not a child abuser, has taken the kid in a bid to match wits with Morgan Freeman, \"perp\" analyst Alex Cross.  Can the kidnapper keep Mika Boorem alive and well, while crossing psychic swords with Freeman yet still pull this caper off?  Will Freeman make a pass at Potter to salve the loss of his partner? It's both fascinating and depressing to watch how one performer of style and class can nearly redeem an inadequately structured film.  In Spider, Morgan Freeman, who has a full payload of both, is in a position to keep this film together, but isn't allowed to do it.  In his role, Freeman  must be able to weave tenuous threads to create personality profiles in narrowing down  suspect lists.  While there's little doubt Freeman could portray such a role with ease, we aren't really allowed to watch the process unfold in Spider.  Director Tamahori, however, is too busy weaving his own threads. In Tamahori's hands, James Patterson's novel becomes a jerky sequence of thinly connected scenarios.  The plot, which is full of wonderful surprises, follows multiple paths.  Like any spider's web, they only meet at the centre after some rather bouncy progress.  Boorem makes a praiseworthy effort to steal the film with her escape attempts.  Potter is fetching enough to distract from her mediocre acting.  Michael Wincott as the kidnapper might have been an excellent foil for Freeman, but the story won't let him.  The story won't let any one individual become outstanding.  On the other hand, the film is too short to let the story develop fully. We are left with a tantalizing result: a plot rich with promise, but too sketchy in its presentation, and actors who might have given award-winning performances had they been given the opportunity to develop the characters.  It's a shame, but you can't award stars for the things that didn't happen. Like so many detective films, there are numerous details that intrude on credibility.  How the kidnapper prepared for the snatch is easily the most astounding.  His \"hideout\" was positioned solely to create a crisis.  If he's intelligent enough to read and understand Cross' books, his blunders are inexcusable.  Without giving away the ransom payoff, someone please explain how the material was to be disposed of without detection.  What steps does Freeman take to work out who the villain is?  These quirks catch the viewer's attention, distracting from the film's value and the protagonists' performance.  The film is easily worth a viewing or two, but to buy it?

Most of my Kiss the Girls  review could be cut and pasted into this one, and that is the film's main failing; there's just not that much new here. The movie is a strictly paint-by-numbers mystery flick of the kind that seems to have been endemic over the past  couple of years. It's a good enough way to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but it ranks in the empty calories section of the video rental shelf: you won't take anything away from it. The film opens with the daughter of a Senator (Michael Moriarty) being kidnapped from her school. The kidnapper gets Cross involved in the investigation  by dropping a piece of evidence off in his mailbox and calling him. Jezzie Flanagan (Potter), who's been the Secret Service agent in charge of guarding the kid, latches onto him, and the two end up as partners in the  investigation. The plot twists show up exactly where you expect them, and should be predictable to anyone who's watched more than five mysteries between The Thirty- Nine Steps and Kiss the Girls. Everyone reacts the way you'd expect them to in every situation. Everything is safe and requires no thought.

Infact, without him this film probably would've been worse. \"Along Came A Spider\" definitly lacks the intrigue of other Freeman crime movies. This one just failed to capture my interest. I think the problem was that I was used to the creepy environments and the brutal murders that were strong in the previous Freeman movies. This one just lacked all that and the mystery.

His first several books were really stunning thrillers, up to and including Cat And Mouse. but since then all his Alex Cross books have just been re-hashings of the same old plots. This book is great. It's a chilling read, with an excellent and truly original plot. Alex Cross comes across as a great compassionate character, who has much life in him. But Unfortunately, patterson tired him out very quickly. With this book Patterson created one of his most chilling victims. He is chilling because Patterson spends time making him so. Developing his character. With his latest books, Patterson doesn't bother developing his villains )or ANY of his characters, for that matter) and just expects us to believe him when he says they are \"a chilling and terrifying killer\" and leaves it at that. With this book, he really shwos us what he can do. He is listening to his fans to much when they say \"can't you write faster\". He has chosen to do so, and in doing that has sacrificed good characters and original plots. This book was a great pageturner and a great thriller, with a really brilliant and unexpected twist right at the end. I cannot reccomend this highly enough. How i wish patterson had stayed with this kind of book, rather than started attending the Danielle Steel school of literature. (i.e. it doesn't matter about the quality, the more the write, the more you sell, so let's laugh all the way to the bank) A once great author. I hope he soon refinds his previous great form which he displayed here.</td><td>An excellent thriller</td><td>1015372800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-06</td><td>Wed </td><td>Mar</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>91</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>73589</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1NXGXR3RYV0Y6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Stephen S.

And in my opinion \"Along Came a Spider\" is his best Alex Cross novel and his first Alex Cross novel. After \"Kiss the Girls\" was made into a remarkable movie I couldn't wait to see what they would do with this and I was, to say the least, extremely disappointed. I can't completely judge the movie without being totally biased cause the book is just sooooo much better. The movie is ok and the people I saw it with liked it, those who hadn't read the book. But why they changed as much as they did and created a faulty storyline from a master plan, the book, is beyond me. The book is so much more complex and deep and requires a lot more thinking than this film allows. It's unsurprising twists make a joke out of the intelligence the book offers. I do wish film makers would take into consideration the merits of the book. If a book is a huge bestseller don't make a movie out of it that changes the story cause most likely your story won't be better. I will say Morgen Freeman is a great actor and I love watching him and he's good in this, but better in \"Kiss the Girls.\" Now I just pray the movie makers leave Alex Cross alone unless they stick to the books.</td><td>Read the book</td><td>1015804800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-11</td><td>Mon </td><td>Mar</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>92</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>73588</td><td>2.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>A152C8GYY25HAH</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Matthew Horner</td><td>Along Came a Spider is Morgan Freeman's second appearance as forensic psychologist Alex Cross. The first was in 1997's Kiss the Girls. This is not a sequel. Cross is a character in a series of books by James Patterson. Like the books they are based on, the movies are thrillers. All thrillers are not created equally, and Along Came a Spider is inferior to its predecessor. Freeman is as good as ever. The movie is full of surprises, and there are indeed some intense moments. The problem is the script. Whenever the movie tries to explain a previous scene, that scene is more full of plot holes than the one it is trying to explain. Still, the movie can prove enjoyable as long as you park your thinking cap next to the popcorn. The movie starts with a wild police pursuit in which Cross' partner is killed. Devastated, Cross goes into seclusion, uncertain whether or not he will be able to work again. Meanwhile, in a posh private school in the District of Columbia, student Megan Rose [Mika Boorem] is kidnapped by a teacher, Gary Sonji [Michael Wincott]. Megan is the daughter of a United States senator. This means that Jezzie Flannigan [Monica Potter], the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the girl, is in a lot of trouble. Cross, drawn against his will into the case, takes her under his wing, and the two set out to find Megan. The road they follow is full of dangerous twists and turns. Besides Freeman and those suspenseful scenes, there are some good elements. I liked Megan, because she is a kid with guts. She is as much heroine as victim, using her wits as often as possible. Wincott makes a convincing villain, effectively utilizing his sinister good looks. The photography is atmospheric and gives the movie a properly creepy look. It's too bad all the good parts of the movie don't make up for the confused plot. It is Sonji who calls Cross after the kidnapping and taunts him into coming out of retirement, but why he does this is never adequately explained. Sonji kidnaps Megan to get to his real target, Megan's best friend at school who is the son of the President of Russia. Why in the world is this kid in an American school? Why didn't Sonji just kidnap him in the first place? These are the kinds of questions many viewers will ask while watching the movie. A thriller generally works through suspension of disbelief. If you don't ask yourself questions until the movie is over, the movie succeeds in its mission. When the questions start during its first half hour, it hasn't done its job properly.</td><td>Only if you like thrill-less thrillers</td><td>1015891200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-12</td><td>Tue </td><td>Mar</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>93</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>73587</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>AYN77RSKL22P6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>L.

I've reed some good classics. Psycho is still one of my favourite, and i cherish Red Dragon. But this book is just awful. Everything is wrong. Everything. The serial killer is not beliveable. He doesn't act as a real serial killer shoudl act. There's nothing more horrible than a serial killer who makes jokes about cutting up someone's penis and shoving it up one's mouth. it's just too funny to come from a man who should be lonely, methodical, devoted to his work. Instead, he has a perfect family and a house with a garden. What happened to the real killers, those who hide human body parts in the basement or in the attic, who have sexual innibitions... who are just real? Then there's his intelligence. He's anything but, because the writer doesn't try to show us that by actions, but merely by telling us. As for the detective, Alex Cross, he's so transparent, without characterization. he spends his time complaining and beeing sorry for the victims. What about thrying to get the killer? Patterson's narrative are even worst. The prose is very simple, as if the readers were too dumb to understand. And then there's his subplots: all that stuff about racism, all seen by the eyes of Cross, who is black. I understand the message, but Patterson doesn't make it sound true. It's not like he ever suffered this problems in his own skin, is it? Thus, avoid this book. There are better thrillers in the market awiting.</td><td>What the hell is this thing?</td><td>1017532800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-31</td><td>Sun </td><td>Mar</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>94</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>73586</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1YCBVMFYBFEOY</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Seung H.

It's not one I have to watch again to figure anything out though, and that's what I gauge a good mystery by...nothing was subtle here and I could see where the story was going clearly. \"Sonji wouldn't ask for money if he had the money if he had the girl\" and then there was a ransom of 'money' asked for... well any mystery buff would have to figure...he must not have had the girl anymore...little things like that stood out.

However, let me set the record straight.  It is \"Along Came a Spider\" that really is the first of the now popular series by James Patterson, not the other one, so perhaps you should consider this as a prequel, not a sequel. As if to show that fact, this film opens with a botched undercover invetigation that ends with a miserably bad result. (And, let me say, so CGI generated car crash scene is.)  Flash forward, and now, feeling guilty of this failure, Alex Cross is thinking about retiring when he is forced to join in another investigation about a kidnapped girl of a senetor in a prestigeous school.  Then his partner turns out to be an FBI agent, who also experienced bitter taste of failed protection service, now feeling guilty as much as Alex.  They start to search for the clues about the girl's whereabout and the criminal's true purpose together until coming to a very unexpected ending of the story. You are to notice that the virtue of the film lies mostly in this unlikely pair of Morgan Freeman as Alex, and Monica Potter as his parter.  In spite of given little chance to reveal their inner characterizations before the audience, their highly convincing acting succeed to enhanse the value of the whole production by several notches, letting us forget the incredible happenings and prediatable settings in the script, which actually, differs radically from the original book, so don't tell anyone about how the story develops even to any of writer James Patterson's avid readers. (For example, villainous 'Soneji' meets another fate in the film version.)  Whether or not you've read the original, it is certain that you will be surprised to find the truth behind the kiddnapping case. Or you might cry out, \"You gotta be kiddin'!\" in which case, I agree, you are not to blame.  The story itself, if you write down on paper to summerize it, would be as believable as scientific theory in \"Independence Day\" or incredible disguise of Mr. Soneji's face -- didn't any one of the teachers there notice his cheesy make-up such a long time? -- but, there you are, you find yourself pretty much entertained by this train of thrilling set-pieces presented with a moody camera. After all, it is Lee Tamahori who is officially selected to do the next 007 series, not Tamanori who directed in his earlier days ruthlessly tough dramas.  This is, as a conclusion, a good timekilling thriller, as thrilling as the Mother Goose song, on which the title is based.  Enough to frighten away Miss Little Muffet away, but too much entangled for us to believe in the story.</td><td>Along Came a Spider to Little Miss with Too Entangled Story</td><td>1022457600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-05-27</td><td>Mon </td><td>May</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>481</td></tr><tr><td>73579</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A5TNZXNPQKGCF</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Barry Lee Dejasu</td><td>This was, simply, the best mystery/thriller book I've ever read.  Constantly kept me guessing, surprises around every corner, and superb characterization!

I liked the shifting viewpoint; you know, first person Alex Cross in one chapter, then third person somebody else in the next, and back and forth and so on.  Also, the very short length of the chapters was especially useful--I hate chapters that go on and on and on so you can't finish them in one night. I am verymuch looking forward to Kiss the Girls; I hope to finish reading all the Cross novels before the next one, FOUR BLIND MICE, comes out in November. And as for the movie, don't blame them!  This novel was HUGE, with LOTS of events and plot and scenes, so it's no wonder that they had to cut so much of it in order to cram it all into a 2 hour movie!  Blame the production company!  Paramount, I think.  In that case, there might have been at least a LITTLE justice.  The movie did fairly well considering how much of the plot it was able to get from the book...okay, maybe not a lot, but enough to make it's own story!!

There's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles, no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff, which was what I expected yet didn't get it.  The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters.  Yeah, I admit it, there are some very short chapters.  Lots.  But that doesn't mean that it's fast paced.  It's fast paced compared to Stephen King, but I think it's a slow paced book.  I want action.  I want adventure.  The killer kills a lot of people.  I didn't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out.  And also, Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller.  He failed miserably.  I don't think I've ever read a good detective novel...all I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes.  If you think this is fast paced, good for you.

The book has truly translated well onto the screen. Morgan Freeman does an excellent job; he plays the character of Cross much less stiffly than we have seen with other genius detective types.  Most of the time, they're so clinical and absorbed (sometimes self-absorbed) that it's difficult to watch them.  At least Denzel Washington was supposed to be stiff in THE BONE COLLECTOR. The strength of the movie relies heavily on a quick change-up surprise which occurs at about twenty minutes from the end of movie, which is good, because once you figure out that not everyone is quite as they seem (and we all know who's going to win), a resolution shouldn't be drawn out too long. I was impressed by Monica Potter's performance.  Most critics called her a copy of Julia Roberts, which isn't a bad thing necessarily.  There is one scene in which the character Soneji is finally killed, and we see some good acting from her, but not only is she a good actress, her character is a good actress as well.  I won't leak too much information, but when the turning point comes, the movie relies much less on Morgan Freeman as a power-actor and turns the spotlight onto Potter.  Michael Wincott, as Soneji, and Mika Boorem, as Megan Rose, also do fine jobs. The movie's not a classic, but the surprise twist does spin your head a bit, and you will definitely not see it coming, unless you've read the book and you know the Alex Cross formula.  It's a palpable thriller, and I can't wait for the next installment in the Alex Cross mysteries.</td><td>An effective slight of hand.......</td><td>1026604800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-07-14</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jul</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>105</td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>73574</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</td><td>0006476155</td><td>TheHighlander</td><td>I give this movie 2.5 stars because it is not bad but yet not really good.

They belong to those of a US senator and actor and then the manhunt for Gary Soneji begins. This was Patterson at his peak. His characyers were well developed, unlike his earlier novels, and Alex Cross especially. In this one he's portrayed as a black detective who struggles to raise his kids in the ghettos of Washington.

Kirkman</td><td>I enjoyed this book, the first of Patterson's Alex Cross stories. The book was very exciting and well written about a psychopath who kidnaps and kills people. The story begins with the character who is the crazy guy, Gary Soneji/Murphy who has multiple severe personality disorders along with being a complete nut-case due to his terrible childhood. Gary Soneji/Murphy plays a school teacher at a day-school for rich kids when his intent is really to kidnap and kill the Dunne/Goldberg children. And finally, one day he lured the children into his van and kidnaps them, drugging one and eventually killing the other child. This kidnapping has the whole DC area up in arms, and Alex Cross works day and night to capture Soneji/Murphy, but he doesn't do that until he kills a few more people in different places. His whole game throughout the book is that he \"Wants to be Somebody.\" He is the master of killing, and he enjoys the game. Alex Cross trys to help all he can, and he gets inside Soneji/Murphy's head and gets him to tell him all of his horrible little secrets after Soneji gets captured the first time and put into prison. Later though, Soneji escapes from prison and causes more problems. More than just Soneji/Murphy though, is an accomplice. Alex fell in love with a female detective on his team, not realizing that she is actually the one behind more of these problems with the kidnappings and knows the answers to what happened with the children.

The pacing is irregular, speeding up and jerking to a halt with no effects on the viewer than mild annoyance.  The \"twists\" are at once so predictable one could deliver the lines right along with the actors having had no prior information about the film and at the same time farfetched, and always unexplained.  Rather than challenging its viewers, it leaves us feeling like the filmmakers decided that they were too tired to fill in the blanks and decided to let the audience figure it out on their own.  And of course it doesn't matter why the characters do what they do, because we don't end up caring about them at all.  Still, when you don't feel like dissecting a movie, Spider takes you on a ride that is fun if completely illogical.  Monica Potter (Head Over Heels) is terrific and young Mika Boorem (Riding in Cars with Boys) delivers an impressive performance.  Boorem's character is not [stupid], either - she's conniving, clever and is one of the only characters who weighs the consequences of her actions before carrying them out.  It's nice to see that respect given to a child's role.  Morgan Freeman (The Sum of All Fears) as Det. Alex Cross is somehow still captivating, despite an annoying, unsympathetic character.  It's an enjoyable movie in its way.

Yet this mind-boggling and somewhat implausible thriller brings back Morgan Freeman to reprise his role as the brilliant forensic detective Alex Cross that he played in \"Kiss The Girls\" to such an electrifying effect. Of course, this whole opening sequence just lays the groundwork for the premise of the film, which is that Freeman's character has been sent into a tailspin, feeling personally  responsible for a colleague's death, and this self-enforced \"retirement\" from active casework becomes one of the provocative elements energizing the action in this thriller. thus, when an influential senator's daughter is kidnapped in broad daylight from an exclusive Washington private school, Cross is pressed into service in order to generate more ink and electronic media interest. Of course, some of the gee-whiz aspects of the plot are implausible, like Cross using advanced computer technology to virtually explore the topography of a suspect's room via a photograph, thereby discovering mind-boggling clues from that photograph that strain the credibility of the plot, but not to worry. We are quickly sped on our way toward another aspect of the developing story. Like the previous movie, there are a number of unanticipated plot twists here top keep one's interest, and the action sequences are very well done. The two aspects of rapid-fire action and a number of bizarre plot turn-arounds have one guessing right up to the end just what the blazes is going on. Like the prior film, it is also an interesting travelogue of the area in which it was shot, this time primarily around the nation's capital. After these two outings, one hopes to see Alex Cross (played by Freeman, of course) will return to truly establish this franchise with a while series of such movies.

I must say I absolutely loved the movie and wished the book would be just as good. The problem is that the events in this book span for so LONG (events take place in a period of almost two years). There actually are pretty good suspense scenes, but they are buried among pages and pages of Cross's reflections. I'm not saying this is bad -actually Alex Cross is one of the better constructed fiction characters I have ever come across- but it really slows down the action. I do agree entirely with one of the reviewers who wrote that the love scenes were tedious and one too many. Maybe it's because the book is so different from the movie (actually the movie just takes the beginning of the novel and then goes on it's own way until the end) or because I rather enjoy Jeffery Deaver's extremely fast paced Lincoln Rhyme novels, but this book didn't do it for me. This is my second Patterson/Cross novel. The first one was Pop Goes the Weasel which I didn't found that good either. I'd like to give the author another shot by reading Roses are Red or Cat and Mouse which seem to be the best books in the series but I just hope they are more of the \"roller coaster ride\" other reviewer's talk about.</td><td>Two and a half actually - not what I expected</td><td>1036368000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-11-04</td><td>Mon </td><td>Nov</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>114</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>73565</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A11M7JW9RKXCGN</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Lauren Adasiak Cocilova</td><td>The characters are colorful and interesting, the plot line is full of twists and intrigue, and I really enjoyed the book.

Both are part of a series featuring the psychologist-detective Alex Cross, a tough Washington DC cop. \"Along came a spider\" is an interesting book. It's the first one in the \"Cross series\", where the readers are introduced to the main characters that will make part in the series, like Cross, his partner Sampson, Cross family, etc. Patterson has a very peculiar style of narrative. His chapters are usually short, wich makes the reading very fast-paced and thrilling. Also, Patterson has two kinds of narrative: one in the first-person where we see what Alex Cross is experiencing and believing, and it's a very personal and one-sided narrative; the other style is in third person, where the reader follows the steps of the main suspect of the crime the story is about. So, to be clear, we KNOW who the killer/murderer/kidnapper/whatever is from the very beggining. Does this spoil the plot or the reading? No! Patterson is master in delivering sub-plots, twists, nuances about characters along the book, all very interesting, and they make the pursuit/manhunt very enjoyable. In \"Along came a spider\", Gary Soneji is the kidnapper fanatic about the Lindberg case, who intents to make history by taking away two very important children. Cross and his teammates in DC Police, FBI and Secret Service have to stop him before he strikes again. This is just the first plot of the story, and it keeps changing every ten or twenty chapters. One thing I found annoying, though, is that Patterson made Cross something like a super-human being. There were times when I thought Cross was virtually invincible. But that is something minor. What really matters is that Patterson created believable characters in one really good thriller. I will surely read the other books in the series, and I'm waiting for Patterson's incursion in medieval times \"The jester\".

But he eventually makes them larger than life and omnipotent to the point of being like Jason in the Friday the 13th movies.  Patterson also forgets his audience has most likely been exposed to a heavy dose of crime solving on TV and in the movies when he renders everyone except Cross so clueless when it comes to finding traces of the killers. Good thing for the rest of the country all serial killers find a way to involve Cross lest the rest of the nation's crime fighters spend all their time eating doughnuts while ignoring tools like DNA and fingerprints.

The plot centers on the kidnapping of a Senator's young daughter from her private school. The kidnapper then gets in touch with famed criminal psychologist Alex Delaware (Morgan Freeman)in an effort to impress him. Delaware has recently lost his partner due to a mistake on his part. To track down the kidnapper, he enlists the help of a beautiful young secret service agent (Monica Potter), who was stationed at the girl's school and is being blamed for the kidnapping. So both individuals are wounded from their past mistakes and anxious to succeed again. The movie then follows the twists and turns of the duo's efforts to solve the kidnapping. Several plot twists near the end (which I won't go into so as not to ruin the viewing experience) vastly improve the movie. The actors are very strong: Morgan Freeman is particularly moving as Alex Delaware and the young actress who plays the kidnapping victim, Megan Ann Rose, is wonderful. I would recommend this movie to those individuals who enjoy the thriller/mystery genre. While you certainly can find a better movie in this category, you also can find a number of poorer ones.

Despite a good story and pacing, however, I didn't find much about this novel to live up to the hype it has received by come. Many of the major characters, notably the \"mysterious\" FBI agent Alex Cross falls for and the children kidnapped, seemed undeveloped and hollow and didn't add anything compelling except to serve as filler characters. The serial killer featured was the lone high acclaim I have...reminiscent to the portrayal by Edward Norton of a killer in the movie Primal Fear, the antagonist in Along Came a Spider is compelling and intriguing, forcing the reader to make decisions that set up the later resolution. The actually \"twist\" ending, however, was disappointing to me as well. Most endings  have elements that were at least SOMEWHAT foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Patterson's ending, however, seemed to come out of left field and was completely arbitrary, with no connections to earlier in the story; in effect it didn't do the madman of the story justice.

No motivation for character's actions, incomphrensible police/forensic work, \"plot twists\" that come out of nowhere, etc. One of the worst -- the little kidnapped girl disappears from the kidnappers boat, but we are never told how this happens (she's locked in securely). Horrible CGI special effects that look cartoonish and totally phony. About all I can say positive is that Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott, along with Monica Potter, Michael Moriarity and several other good actors, try valiantly to use talent and charisma to make SOMETHING of the material, but with a script this incoherent they didn't stand a chance.

James Patterson brilliantly keeps up the tension throughout the novel. As with great stories like this the villain seems unlikely at first but all the clues are there and it all fits! Detective Alex Cross, a hardbitten black cop / psychology major from DC, is investigating a series of gruesome deaths in the ghettos of Washington when he and his partner get dragged off on a case involving the kidnapping from an exclusive private school of two children. One is the son of the secretary of the treasury; the other, Maggie Rose, is the daughter of a famous movie star. Initially Dr. Cross is annoyed at all the attention being focussed on the privileged but he finds himself getting dragged into the case. It appears that a Gary Soneji, a teacher at the school who was so well liked he was named Mr. Chips, kidnapped the children out of the blue. As the plot thickens, leads seem to connect to the ghetto killings, one of the children turns up dead, a ransom is paid and lost and the kidnapper proves elusive. Alex Cross, vilified for his role in the handing over of the ransom, finds solice in the figure of Jezzie Flanagan - the prime secret service minder of the two children. The relationship, crossing racial boundaries, adds more tension. The figure of Gary Soneji, the alter-ego of a Gary Murphy, is a brilliant creation up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter. At least you know where you are with Mr. Lecter - Murphy/Soneji keep you guessing all the way - scary! James Patterson brilliantly handles all of the threads, not letting any of them unravel and adding twist after clue after hint. The final unveiling of the villain is wonderful - suprising, but the clues are all there to find.</td><td>Keeps you guessing all the way</td><td>1070323200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2003-12-02</td><td>Tue </td><td>Dec</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>131</td><td>328</td></tr><tr><td>73525</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>If you were a HUGE fan of this book by James Patterson, then keep in mind this is merely based off the book.  There are parts that are left out of the movie that could've otherwise been included. The story is the same but other things could've been differentiated. Matt Whittman plays Gary Soneji, a kidnapper at a private school who kidnaps the senator's daughter. Morgan Freeman plays Detective Alex Cross on his trail. Monica Potter plays Jezzie Flanagan, Cross' alias in getting Soneji. I guess the first annoyance of this movie is that its only \"based\" off the book. So a lot is changed around.  The beginning starts off with Cross' partner (and it isn't Sampson for those of you who read the book) in a car with a killer and eventually action comes into play and she's soon killed off merely 5 minutes into the movie (not including the opening credits). There's the attention grabber...unfortunately the movie can only go downhill from there. Gary Soneji is very out of character. This isn't bad for those who haven't read the book.  But the movie fails to show depth to Soneji's character.  This isn't just Soneji but Alex Cross as well. The characters in the movie feel wooden at times.  The dialogue is pretty corny at times so likewise most characters feel the same. The other part that annoys me is in the book they constantly told you that Gary Soneji wanted to commit the crime of the century.  In the movie there is no motivation whatsoever so you wonder \"What is Soneji's motive?\"  \"Why is he doing this?\"  Believe me you'll learn that it isn't for money. The plot twist wasn't done too well either.  We're supposed to believe that the senator's daughter was kidnapped from the boat Soneji imprisoned her on when we NEVER see it happen!  You wonder how she got to her new location near the end of the movie. Lastly, the ending.  With a few exceptions its easy to say the ending is usually changed for the worst and in this movie IT WAS FOR THE WORST!  Alex finds the girl and then it just...ends. No falling action or resolution it just ends. If you really loved the book the movie will more than likely disappoint you. If you didn't read the book the movie has a \"Love/Hate\" relationship.  I'm sure that if you haven't read the book you could pull the movie apart.</td><td>Disappointment if you were really into the book</td><td>1075248000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-01-28</td><td>Wed </td><td>Jan</td><td>49</td><td>1</td><td>132</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>73524</td><td>1.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>AKI86OM0M5QLV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amy B.</td><td>I love James Patterson novels with all my heart, but this movie is the epitome of why you should never see a movie based on a book.

I won't tell you who did the crimes, but I'm only saving you about five minutes of time: once you're that far into the movie, you'll have it all figured out. The movie borrows heavily from \"Seven,\" \"Silence of the Lambs,\" and another, much better Morgan Freeman movie, \"Kiss the Girls.\" That was also written by James Patterson, but the director managed to make it a decent movie anyway. Watch any of those, they won't insult your intelligence quite as much.</td><td>Save your money</td><td>1081468800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-04-09</td><td>Fri </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>134</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>73522</td><td>4.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Lonnie E. Holder</td><td>It seems as though I am in the minority with this film.  I enjoyed the plot twists, though you had to follow them carefully.  If you were watching you could, in theory, figure out who the bad guys are, though you really do not have all the facts to truly figure out every detail, somewhat like a Sherlock Holmes story. Our story focuses on one Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), who has carefully planned to kidnap the daughter of U.S. Senator Hank Rose, unconvincingly played by Michael Moriarty.  The point of the kidnapping is not to kidnap Megan (Mika Boreem), but to get access to a foreign diplomat's son, who is good friends with Megan.  Mr. Soneji is, as might be guessed, a bit of a wacko.  He wants Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), a famous profiler, to chronicle the battle of wits between them.  Ultimately there is a showdown between the two of them, but the showdown does not reveal the location of Megan. The plot twists and thickens more, and yet, there were clues in several places, I thought.  I was quite puzzled when the security guards went running out the front of the school instead of just closing the gates.  Further, I thought someone would have at least tried to grab a car to follow the kidnapper.  Later, Jezzie Flanagan (Monica Potter) has a chance to shoot the kidnapper and does not, though she seemed to have a chance to wound him.  All these little tidbits hint at the convolutions within the plot that are revealed only near the end of the movie. The convolutions did entertain me, and I got much more enjoyment out of trying to figure out the plot than with gunshots and car chases.  However, I prefer \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Columbo,\" and \"Sherlock Holmes\" to movies with nearly all action and no intelligence in their plot.  When you watch this movie, you do have to pay attention or you will lose direction, and you will see more plot holes than there actually are.  I thought nearly everything was explained as the movie progressed, and the only plot holes were mistakes by those involved in the kidnapping of Megan. There were four standout actors in this film.  Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, as Alex Cross.  Michael Wincott is quite convincing as the marginally sane Gary Soneji.  Monica Potter brings a good balance of strength and vulnerability to her role as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flanagan.  The real surprise performance is by Mika Boreem as Megan Rose.  Megan tries very hard to get away throughout the movie, and uses her head continuously, incidentally saving her own life.  Mika's performance is better than many of the adult actors in this film, and bodes well for a future career in acting. It could just be that I'm getting older, and car chases and flying bullets just are not as enjoyable as they once were.  Or it could be that I just liked the intellectual challenge of unraveling the threads of the complicated plot.  In any case, this movie is clearly not for everyone, but I would love to watch it again.</td><td>Convoluted Plot</td><td>1082246400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-04-18</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>135</td><td>545</td></tr><tr><td>73521</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A3MV1KKHX51FYT</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Acute Observer</td><td>The daughter of Senator Rose is kidnapped by her \"teacher\"; another teacher is killed.

Not only will you enjoy the writing which propells the suspense and mystery, but you'll also enjoy the character development.

Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or `Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here). This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex.

To the movie: I have not read the Alex Cross novels, so I am not able to comment on the movies based on them being faithful or not to the book. I HAVE seen both \"Along Came A Spider\" and \"Kiss the Girls\" and I enjoyed \"Spider\" much more, even though KTG was a good stab at the thriller genre. Morgan Freeman inhabits Alex Cross more completely, and I suspect that my appreciation of his performance was a combination of his wonderfully intelligent acting and Lee Tamahori's direction.  This version of Cross is intelligent, compassionate, brave, and scarcely takes a wrong step.  He'd be a good teacher and a good person to go get a beer with.  And if some psychotic killer were on your trail - he's the guy you'd want tracking the killer. *WARNING! Silence of the Lambs Spoiler in this paragraph!* The writers of thrillers have begun doing cartwheels trying to out \"surprise\" all that came before.  I can't pinpoint when this began.... but do you remember the surprise in \"Silence of the Lambs\" when Hannibal Lector suddenly appears from beneath the sheets in the ambulance?  The story here throws in several twists, and although in the lesser thriller you can often sense the \"twists\" a country mile before it occurs, I found myself genuinely surprised several times. It is worth mentioning both the character and performance given by young Mika Boorem as Megan Rose, the kidnapped daughter of a U.S. Senator.  In many thrillers adults often behave as if they've been lobotomized, with victims giving killers ample opportunity to have their way and with killers who give the hero a boring explanation of their motives as they also give the hero plenty of time to get the drop on them.  Megan Rose is no such character.  She is smart, resourceful, and after being kidnapped she plainly has no plans other than escaping.  A handful of times she thwarts the villains in ways that would not be thought of by any of the adults you see on \"Jerry Springer\". Monica Potter stands up adequately next to Morgan Freeman's powerful performance as Jezzie, the Secret Service Agent who was supposed to be guarding Megan when she is kidnapped suddenly by one of her teachers at her upscale prep school.  It seemed a little odd to me that Alex Cross would be initially reluctant to form an alliance with a Secret Service Agent when in \"Kiss The Girls\" he doesn't have any problem with becoming investigative partners with an amateur - a medical intern. There are several sequences which I found clever and suspenseful, such as the one in which a ransom of a thermos full of diamonds is transferred to the kidnapper - I always wonder how kidnappers think they're going to get away with it when they're trying to ransom - for you to get your loot you HAVE to go to where the loot is, right?  And if the ransom is several million, won't the cops be waiting for you?  The way THIS kidnapper overcomes this dillemma is ingenious.... and I read on the IMDB that this sequence was based on a similar sequence from \"High and Low\" by Kurosawa. At one point Alex Cross finds himself in the kidnapper's house, looking at two years of work that went into developing the kidnapping plan and he plainly has some admiration. \"Imagine the patience...the dedication...\" he murmurs. Jezzie responds \"You sound like an admirer.\" \"Well, he's like a spider. I happen to like spiders.\" I happen to like movies with clever villains, clever resourceful victims, sequences that pay homage to Kurosawa, and smart characters and actors like Morgan Freeman. Plus you can buy it for less than a rental at Blockbuster....</td><td>4 1/2 Stars actually - This DVD is a bargain!</td><td>1098057600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-10-18</td><td>Mon </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>141</td><td>667</td></tr><tr><td>73514</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1VHK9A4VLJTHC</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Michael Beverly</td><td>I gave When the Wind Blows a horrible review and had only read one other book by Patterson, which was a terrorist thriller of average quality, when I decided to bite the bullet and try this one out. Obviously some people really like his style and stories, so I figured this one, made into a movie, couldn't be THAT bad.  I wasn't too disappointed, in fact, since I expected it to stink, I was actually a bit impressed. If you're into chick written mystery thrillers, then this one will probably appeal to you.  I tend to enjoy more meaty offerings, Caleb Carr's great historical murder thrillers come to mind and Scott Turow's mysteries (lawyer based).  These types of books really get into the characters and don't rely so much on the \"hyper\" plot with out of the world, head line grabbing stories. This book makes the same mistakes that I found in the decent thriller Absolute Power, in which stuff happens that really could never happen.  I understand that is one of the points of certain types of fiction \"Blockbuster\" fiction, if you will, but it doesn't have to be so over the top. In any case, this one's a fairly quick read, and not a total let down, as for those that give this book the kind of glowing \"best novel ever\" type reviews, well, I don't believe those people have read much fiction. The cover of the paperback copy I read of this title had a glowing endorsement by Nelson DeMille, who is a superb writer, I'd recommend all his books before going to this series, but if you're a quick reader with lots of time, I'm going to give this an okay recommendation.</td><td>Average thriller, over the top plot complete with holes</td><td>1102291200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2004-12-06</td><td>Mon </td><td>Dec</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>142</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>73513</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1EBSH1071FMOJ</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Gracey London</td><td>Definitely not worth the time investment. I don't read many thrillers--they're not my cup of tea--but as far as books in general go, this book was rather bad.  Maybe all thrillers lack emotional depth and run along flat, clich plot lines.  Or maybe this was just a bad thriller.  In either case, this isn't a book that I would recommend to any of my friends. It wasn't necessarily _bad_, but neither was it particularly good. There's a lot of unnecessary words in there.  I could have typed up a plot synopsis of 500 words in half an hour, read it, imagined it all happening, and gotten the same enjoyment that I did reading 500+ pages. The plot's on the clich side.  It's redeemed in part by the twist toward the end, which is nicely foreshadowed in the chapters immediately before it, but the location, the conflict and the resolution are all much too conventional. The writing style's quick and clean, and the chapters are short, which makes for fast reading.  Thank God, because if the style had dragged any more than it did, I probably wouldn't have gotten through the book.  I felt that I could've put the book down at any moment while I was reading and not felt the urge to pick it back up.  It didn't scare me, it didn't move me, didn't make me laugh or cry... I felt mild curiosity at times, but that was it. In a book this long, you'd think there'd be at least a sentence or two worth remembering.  The kind of perfect phrase or chapter ending that makes you sigh and go, \"Yeah, baby, now _that's_ good writing.\"  There was exactly one sentence in the entire book that made me stop and read it again, and that was \"Dreams are as powerful as the real world to our nervous systems.\"  And that's only because I've been having some crazy dreams of late and experienced that statement first-hand.  It's good enough writing, but not anywhere near excellent. _Along Came a Spider_ isn't a bad book.

Tresca</td><td>I knew of two movies involving the character of Alex Cross: Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls.  I've seen neither and was interested as to what this mini-franchise is all about.  Plus I think Morgan Freeman is the bomb and was thrilled to hear he was the movie lead. The movie starts out with Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) following his partner, a pretty female cop who is a passenger to a known serial killer.  It's all a clever sting (oh the insect metaphors, I can't help myself!), but the plan falls apart when the serial killer decides he'd like a little pre-warm-up activity from his passenger. In an inexplicable moment of vulnerability, Cross' partner starts wailing that she doesn't want her face shoved into the lap of a serial killer.  Which is understandable, but not what we would expect of a cop trained to go undercover as serial killer bait.  Sure enough, the bad guy discovers the cop's ploy when he finds her earpiece (whatever happened to wires?) and things go downhill from there. The cop draws a gun on her companion, who freaks out.  Or maybe it's the cop who freaks out.  She shoots him dead, the car spins out of control and lands on the edge of a bridge (or a dam, hard to tell).  She screams helplessly for Cross' help, who can't save her.  She plunges to her death. This makes Cross understandably morose about his profession.  What is his profession, exactly?  It seems he's a cop.  But he's written a book about serial killers, so perhaps he's a profiler.  Since I'm writing my own book about this very subject, I found it curious that Cross' expertise is never fully explained.  Every mystery author wants his good guy to be a Bob Ressler or a John Douglas.  But it takes work to pull off these men as actual people as opposed to walking caricatures of Sherlock Holmes. Fade to... Children of important diplomats and politicians are sequestered in a high-security school known as the Cathedral.  There, kids attend weird classes with projects like, \"find Charles Lindbergh on the Web in the smallest number of hops.\"  Get it?  Web?  Spider? I know, I was stunned by the connection too. As it turns out, the teacher of the class is actually a highly trained kidnapper, Gary Soneji (played by the gravelly Michael Wincott of The Crow and The Three Musketeers fame).  Soneji's been buried within the Cathedral hierarchy for two years using latex appliances and an amazing device that conceals his fingertips. We're never told where Soneji acquired these skills.  My guess is he was an ex-government agent of some country.  But the movie deems those facts unimportant.  What's important is that Soneji knows of Cross--he's read Cross' book, after all--and decides he will provide the kidnapping of the century by mimicking the kidnapping of the Lindbergh Baby. This of course means he makes an obligatory phone call, voice disguised, to Cross, thus dragging him into the plot. Soneji kidnaps poor Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), daughter of Senator Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty, of Law and Order fame, who only gets like three lines).  But really, Megan's just a ploy to get closer to another, more important child (Dmitri Stardubov, played by Anton Yelchin) of a Russian diplomat.  Imagine, if Soneji kidnapped the little Russian boy, there'd be an \"INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.\" Those words are expressed over and over.  We're never entirely sure what the implications are, but they sound really bad.  Why is the Russian boy in an American school?  Why would it create an incident?  Who is the kid's father, anyway? Bristling after the embarrassing loss of her charge, Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) is determined to catch the bad guy.  That's JEZZIE, not JESSIE, for some reason I cannot fathom. After all, it's thanks to her bumbling and another agent, Ben Devine (Billy Burke), that the Megan was kidnapped. Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker), another agent, is put on the case, for the sole purpose of insulting Cross and then barking orders at people. The character of Soneji seems awkwardly conceived.  Is her supposed to be a serial killer?  We discover that Soneji did burn down his parents' house when he was young, a trait that's definitely evident in serial killers.  He's most decidedly the \"organized\" type, capable of holding down a job, purchasing a boat, and doing a lot of other things that require an orderly, structured mind.  But he's so one-dimensional, so utterly focused on being known as a kidnapper, that his later confession about his past seems forced.  In essence, Soneji feels like a villain some writer (James Patterson wrote the novel, Marc Moss wrote the screenplay) whipped up to be a foil for our hero. It turns out the kids use \"Stego\" encryption to conceal the \"equivalent of passing notes\" in .GIF files that they send to each other in class.  Megan and Dmitri use it and Soneji does too.  He leaves clues to the kidnapping embedded in those .GIF files, revolving around Charles Lindbergh.  One of those clues leads to the World's Clearest Webcam, which focuses on a patch of wall in Soneji's home (!). It's a sad statement about the movie industry that many of the plot points that lead to the real bad guys have to do with incompetence on the part of the authorities.  There are several situations throughout the film where people don't do what they should to catch the bad guy, but the movie provides these moments as obvious, \"duh, they were incompetent on PURPOSE,\" examples. See, I was far too preoccupied with the fact that Soneji walks in and out of peoples' homes unchallenged, that he seems to know where everyone is at all times, to start questioning other stupidity like security guards not reacting fast enough or shooting when they should.  What's thrown out as proof of another, secret plan to make money off of a kidnapping is lost in the morass of confusing plot points.  In other words, if you're going to use discrepancies in character actions to reveal the mystery, everything else going on in the movie better be sewed up tightly. It isn't. The person who carries most of the movie is really Boorem, who plays a clever, frightened girl quite capable of escaping on her own, thank-you-very-much.  She manages not one but two major escapes from the bad guys without help from anybody.  Boorem's scenes are the best part of the film. Potter is suitably nervous and frustrated as a pretty agent, but she's a little too severe to empathize with.  That said, she has such a striking resemblance to Julia Roberts that it's distracting.  She has the same smile, same drawl, same arching eyebrows.  Potter just doesn't have the charm, but then again that might be appropriate for the plot. Then there's Freeman, who adopts the tired, world-weary narrative that he did better in Se7en and The Shawshank Redemption.  At one point, Cross has to run all over town at the kidnapper's whim, such that the scene becomes comical rather than compelling.  Freeman deserves better. Along Came a Spider tries to be serious, mysterious, action-packed, scary, and ironic.  We know this because the music forcefully tells us when those moments are.  But the movie just doesn't have a compelling plot to back it up. Even with the major twist mid-movie. In a lot of ways, the film reminded me of the Watcher.  And that's not a compliment.</td><td>Oh what a tangled Web we weave!</td><td>1114905600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-05-01</td><td>Sun </td><td>May</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>144</td><td>1298</td></tr><tr><td>73511</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2E9Q3T876TQ6C</td><td>0006476155</td><td>L.

Soneji is also known as Son of Lindbergh, a murdering serial kidnapper that has outsmarted most of Washington's law enforcement. I also must say that Soneji is one of Patterson's most diabolical villains to date - he doesn't torture his victims the way we saw the villain in KISS THE GIRLS do, but he is much smarter and that can be very scary all by itself! Because of Soneji's brainpower, he's kept ahead of the law in the past. Now Alex Cross is on his trail and the going gets much more difficult for Soneji. Alex Cross is a homicide detective with a doctorate in psychology. Most of the readers can relate to this main character because he's an average guy, who's down to earth. In this book he does have one obsession - he is attracted to a female supervisor of Washington's Secret Service. Cross is determined to stop Soneji before his madness can kill another person and must work around the conflicting emotions set in place by his affair with another in law enforcement. ALONG CAME A SPIDER is definitely a great. Patterson's first book, KISS THE GIRLS was awesome, but this one is even better than the last! The reader can easily relate to the easy going, down-to-earth character of Alex Cross, who plays the piano when he's troubled, or enjoys playing with his children. I think the normalcy of this character helps draw the reader into the story, until you can't put it down. Patterson's villains seem to be created from a nightmare too terrible to remember.

Having read the awesome book, I was expecting an excellent movie. But.... This movie was really bad. It was completely different than the book and was way too short. Oh, and by the way, for all of you people that are saying that this is the sequel to Kiss the Girls, it's NOT!!!! Along Came a Spider is the first and the sequel is Kiss The Girls!!!! The book was absolutely brilliant and kept you on the edge of your seat for the whole time. This movie strays far away from it and instead greatly reduces the story. The end comes way too abruptly while on the other hand, the book was a lot longer. The kidnapper, Gary Soneji, eludes the police numerous times in the book and does a lot more. On top of it, in the book, you never know if the killer has a split personality and it's not his fault because of his mental condition or if he's just evil and crazy. The movie isn't even that bad but it screwed over the movie. I think that the director of this movie only read the first 100 pages and then made a movie. A lot more happens! This movie is just way too short, and ruins an excellent book. My recommendation is to read the book and forget the movie. The book is excellent, thrilling and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Oh and by the way, Alex Cross was supposed to be a young detective not a 60 year old one! Morgan Freeman is great but that kind of ruins the books a little because there are a lot of books and this young detective meets many new foes. Forget any sequels after Kiss the Girls.</td><td>?????????</td><td>1121731200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-19</td><td>Tue </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>147</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>73508</td><td>4.0</td><td>22</td><td>false</td><td>A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Marc Ruby&amp;#8482;</td><td>I have to admit that I never quite understand why a director would decide to make a movie of a perfectly good suspense/mystery story (a best seller no less) and proceed to make wholesale modifications to the plot.  It almost guarantees that a good piece of the audience will dislike the film simply because it diverges from the book and never even notice that it is a good film all on its own. And it is a good film.  Morgan Freeman does a superb job of portraying Detective Alex Cross as he tries to peel away the layers of a kidnapping that gets away from everyone - kidnapper and police alike.  Gary Soneji(Michael Wincott), a teacher at a posh school for the children of the powerful, decides to improve his social standing by kidnapping Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), a senator's daughter.  He has everything worked out in detail, including getting Cross out of of semi-retirement, in order to demonstrate Soneji's brilliance. Joined by Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter). who was the secret service agent on duty when Soneji makes his move, Cross begins to sift through the details to try to understand Soneji enough to win Megan's Freedom.  With each fact comes more confusion and the plot will zigzag all over the event horizon before the final confrontation.  In many ways, this is a compelling combination of police procedural and suspense/psychotic film as the film switches back and forth between Cross and Soneji.  A lot of people get shot, but the film doesn't dwell on the gory parts. Mika Boorem does a fantastic job as the kidnapped girl, by the way.  She manages to find an unusual balance between fearful weakness and a surprising inner strength.  The film is well directed in a nicely understated way.  If it wasn't for the arbitrary changes to an already good plot Along Came A Spider would have been a real winner.  But even so, the basic surprises are carried over from the book to the film, the work is good, and the popcorn is warm.  If you like tricky detection tales, you'll find this film entirely satisfactory.</td><td>\"I am living proof, that a mind is a terrible thing\"</td><td>1121990400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-22</td><td>Fri </td><td>Jul</td><td>102</td><td>53</td><td>148</td><td>365</td></tr><tr><td>73507</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3P3UOHYBFRGJN</td><td>0006476155</td><td>David A.

After his partner dies on a sting mission to catch a serial killer Cross retires unitl a senator's daughter is kidnapped and the kidnapper, Soneji, calls him, in order to make him famous as he copies the Lindbergh child kidnapping and tries to be imortalized for the crime of teh century.  After Cross looks at the details he is joined by Monica Potter, who is Jezzie, a secret service agent who was supposed to protect the little girl but failed.  After tracking the kidnapper and almost catching him twice and stopping him from his real mission, to kidnap the Russian presidents son, they finally get him. As Cross goes over the details inhis head he realizes someone has been on to him and is double crossing him, as he knows Soneji doesn't have the little girl anymore, so after Soneji nearly kills Jezzie, Cross kills him.  Thinking that he lost teh only lead to finding the little girl, Jezzie and the girl's parents are very angry with him.  But Cross hown his details to the Secret Service officers who are also onthe case and they see that one of there own was following Soneji for a long time and knew of this, and kidnapped the girl from Soneji and took a 10 million dollar ransom.  As Cross goes over more clues he sees the double crosser is now being double crossed by their partner and he rushes to a dramatic and surprising ending to save the little girl.

The movie wasn't all that bad, but it was lacking.  There is so much action in the book and I just don't understand why they didn't put more of that action into the movie.  If half of the action scenes from the book were included in the movie, I guaruntee I would have given it at least two more stars.  The worst part of the movie, in my opinion is when Alex Cross just so happens to guess the completely improbable password for Jezzie's computer.  Not only that, but she has a picture of her rental house and all its information on her computer.  Who does that?!  Since he got all the information about the house on Jezzie's computer, he goes to the house and saves the day.  That scene ruined the movie for me.  If you liked the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend reading it.

Even allowing for the extra description required to set up a character so that a series can be made out of him (i.e. Alex Cross), Patterson drags this story at best. I will admit that I read the first 250 or so pages VERY quickly, but all of a sudden the novel seemed to lose steam.  Combine this with the budding romance of Alex Cross that was focused on to the nth degree and did nothing to advance the plot and it made for a very difficult novel to complete. I made myself finish the novel because I was eager to get on to other Alex Cross novels that I knew received rave reviews.  I too do not like to read a series out of order so I forced myself through the remaining pages.  However, I found myself questioning whether or not ANY of the other Alex Cross books would be worth reading (they are, don't worry) during the course of this book. One last bit before I conclude, I was INCREDIBLY disturbed by the final chapters of this novel and I do not feel much of the description was necessary to get Patterson's view across. With all this being said, please do not use Spider as a judge for the other books in the Alex Cross series.  I have not come upon these issues again in any of the other Cross novels I have completed.  But, suffice it to say that it took a little while for Patterson to find a rhythm for his most famous leading man.</td><td>I know I'm probably alone here...</td><td>1127347200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-09-22</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>154</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>73501</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AWPN0LDV9K9BR</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Bill Marks</td><td>Starting the first Alex Cross novel was one of the best books i have ever read.

In one review someone said the romance with Alex Cross didn't really contribute to anything and i will agree because there really was no use for the relationship considering the only real relationship they had was sex and mind games (towards the end). But this book has the greatest twists and turns in almost any novel i have ever read that you can esily over look the dumb romance. I want to tell everyone the mega twist but i urge you to find out for yourselves. I will go ahead and say it concerns an unthinkable betrayel and you find out at the end of chapter 75.

He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider.</td><td>MUCH better than Kiss The Girls...</td><td>1138579200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2006-01-30</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>160</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>73495</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>A1YWUHRJDMATPI</td><td>0006476155</td><td>P. Robinson</td><td>This is the only Alex Cross book that gets 5 stars. I love Alex Cross, but most of the series only get 3 or 4, and everything after \"Violets are Blue\" gets only 1 star. Here is why:  Patterson had a very strong creation in Alex Cross. He was an interesting character with flaws and emotions. Also, he wasn't a \"tough-guy\" hero; he was a man who used his mind to solve crimes. He is a psychologist, not a rogue cop that makes up his own rules.  Also, in this book he is pitted against a very unique and clever villain - Gary Soneji - a madman who kidnaps a young girl from a private school who has a very powerful father. This book has a great plot and moves at a breakneck speed. There is little time for description or introspection on the part of the characters, and that is what makes this book great. There are countless twists and turns, and the reader is constantly guessing. Now, that being said, it is Patterson's style of writing that makes this book amazing, and the rest of them derivative pulp.  Patterson insists on having over 100 chapters in each of his books. This is not to say they are long books, rather each chapter is merely 2-3 pages long. This in itself is not the problem. The problem is that each chapter starts halfway down the page [leaving half a page of white space] and the chapter will end at the beginning of a new page, only a few lines down [leaving another half page of white space].  I have heard many readers say that they love Patterson, because they read his books so quickly. Well, the fact is that the buyer is paying for about 35 percent white space in any given Patterson book - which is only about 300 pages long in the first place! Now, again, I am not saying this is bad. It is a technique that gives the feeling of incredible suspense as one is literally turning the pages faster than can be imagined when reading a book of substance. However, after the first book in this series I was tired of this device, and I can finish an Alex Cross book in just over an hour.  I may as well have been watching television!  Anyhow, this first book is worth reading, however, please be skeptical of anyone who thinks they are literati because they can devour a whole Patterson book in one sitting.  Buy this book, but make sure that you buy the rest of this series from a used book store so Patterson is not rewarded for his 120 pages of white space per novel.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and would recommend it on the basis that it's an interesting, undemanding read: perhaps one to go for if you've just spent days ploughing through something a little more 'literary', which this sure isn't!!</td><td>My faith in Patterson is restored</td><td>1170892800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2007-02-08</td><td>Thu </td><td>Feb</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>174</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>73475</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AH7EWQ7HHVBH0</td><td>0006476155</td><td>ZoSo</td><td>This is, simply, a very entertaining book.

Effective disguises and role-playing over long periods of time, plus the ability to wait for years to execute a crime plan, is what makes Gary Murphy/Soneji so frightening. I had read Kiss the Girls earlier, with no background on Alex Cross.  Reread it and found that what I remembered were the characters Kate and Scootchie.  I had totally forgotten who did the crimes...in Kiss the Girls this is revealed at the very end...we're surprised but also disappointed since we don't know this guy as a human being at all, only as Casanova.  Casanova and the Gentleman Caller are not portrayed with anything like the depth of Patterson's Gary character. Also Patterson handles the surprise ending much better in Spider.  Jezzie's name should tip us off (Jezebel?), as well as the fact that her relationship with Alex is just too too magazine-story perfect.  But the gradual revelation of what happened to Maggie Rose - as well as how and why - is well done and seeing her reunited with her mother is very satisfying. I enjoy Alex and his family, his midnight porch piano-playing, etc., as well as Man Mountain Sampson, Nana Mama and the kids.  At the end of Kiss the Girls, it is clear that Soneji will be coming around again (shades of The Poet, by Michael Connelly).  Yeah, it's different to know who the criminal is, early on...maddening to watch him dance away...but hey, that's what being hooked on this stuff is all about!</td><td>Things (and people) are not always what they seem...</td><td>1177372800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2007-04-24</td><td>Tue </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>176</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>73473</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A26MX1ZPYF20KV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Roogirl06</td><td>This was the second book i had read of JP's.

It is not clear why the emphasis on race was downplayed as the series progressed. Once again, we see the super-crafty criminal, a murderer and kidnapper.  Such figures dominate thrillers, whereas in real life, the criminals tend to be below normal in intelligence and make mistake after mistake.  Perhaps mediocre to stupid just isn't interesting enough.  If I have a fault with the plot, it is the villain's talent and the attempt to cram too much of this into too few pages.  Jeopardy, of course, is what fuels the story, but too much is still too much. The detailed, R-rated inter-racial love interest is distracting from the plot.  It does figure in the finale, but it might have been done better.  It just seemed manipulative, put into the book for the prurient reader.

At a high-security private school, math teacher Gary Soneji kidnapped two students - Michael Goldberg, whose father is the Secretary of the Treasury, and Maggie Rose Dunne, the daughter of a famous actress. Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist who works as a DC homicide detective. After being pulled off a serial killer case in one of DC's lower-income neighborhoods, Alex is thrown into the hunt for Michael and Maggie Rose, as well as apprehending Gary Soneji. Michael soon turns up dead, and Gary Soneji is arrested in a McDonalds far from the capital city. There's just one problem. Gary Soneji is known to the world as Gary Murphy, a quiet man who works hard to provide for his family. This is not the image that the kidnapper, who calls himself the \"Son of Lindbergh\", has given himself. Does he suffer from multiple personality disorder? Or is he just putting on an act for the police? And what has happened to Maggie Rose? During the next two years, Alex Cross develops a relationship with Gary. But when things start to look strange, he begins to ask questions that reach far into the government. Who is Gary Murphy/Soneji? And how exactly does Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan fit into the puzzle? \"Along Came a Spider\" is James Patterson's first Alex Cross novel, and it is truly a page-turning thriller. With a vividly-described and likable protagonist and a mystery with more turns than a maze, Patterson has created a world that will stay with you long after the final secret is revealed.</td><td>What Happened to Maggie Rose?</td><td>1206662400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2008-03-28</td><td>Fri </td><td>Mar</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>184</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>73465</td><td>4.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</td><td>0006476155</td><td>R.

Next, there's a kidnapping at a DC school for VIP Children. Emily Rose (the daughter of Senator Rose) is kidnapped by her teacher. Mika Boorem plays young Emily and this kid is not your average hostage.  She's a bright young girl and she fights back. Alex Cross is still recovering in his home when the kidnapper calls him and involves him in the case.  It seems the man wants to become as famous Lindbergh kidnapper.  Dr. Cross is along to 'document the case.' Cross is joined by Jezzie Flannigan (Potter) the Secret Service agent at the school who failed to see the kidnapper as a threat. \"Along Came a Spider\" is a fast-paced thriller with the added value of a child hostage and two police who are trying to prove themselves after failures.  If I could ask James Patterson one question, it would be who he had in mind for Dr. Alex Cross when he wrote the novels.

And it works not because of the kidnapping of the child. Not because of the pathos that comes along with such a case all the time, every time. Not because of the failed attempt of the girl to escape. Not because of the child's father's over-reacting. It works because the plot is too simple to be accepted like that. A solitary man could not have planned and realized that plot in Washington DC, with the Russian security services looking after the son of the Ambassador and the secret service working there full time in that private school. Too much security in that school for such a kidnapping to have been done by only one person. Then there must have been accomplices and that's how the film works because we do not know who he or she or they is or are and we are looking out for the clues, for the punch line, for the final and supreme plotter. And that's just what it is all about, one plotter double-crossing the other or the others, or even maybe three tiers instead of just two, and maybe even four tiers, and we are double-crossed in a magnificent way just the very same way the profiling cop is double-crossed in a very standard way. The profiler is profiled by the criminal and then side-tracked because when you know the profile of the profiler the profiler becomes predictable and then inefficient, impotent. So that helps to take the medicine down indeed, even if the girl survives only because the criminals did not do one thing right, only one thing, one single and unique thing. It only takes one mistake for the best adventures to fail. Just find out which thing and who.

First of all, let me begin by saying that I'm a big advocate of reading series' from beginning to end, without skipping books along the way.  Because of that, and because I can unequivically tell you that the Cross books only get better, I'm giving Along Came a Spider 3 stars and recommending that it be read. With that in mind, this book was SLOW.  I understand that Patterson was working to set up the lives of characters who would be carried over for later novels in the series, but the overall action in this book was a drag.  Heck, even the timeline of the story spans more than two years! I greatly respect James Patterson.  He's one of my favorite authors and I will be the first to tell anyone that the novels in the Alex Cross series typically make for really great reads.  But, I've got to be honest with you regarding the first one - The engine definitely took a while to leave the station for this series starter.</td><td>Mediocre start to a great series...</td><td>1226620800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2008-11-14</td><td>Fri </td><td>Nov</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>191</td><td>216</td></tr><tr><td>73458</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3Q33XPEYEZJ5W</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Reads Thrillers</td><td>The actions and inter-actions of the authorities were not realistic as the Secret Service is responsible for protecting not for investigations.

Most of the book deals with the examination of the kidnapper/murderer and that is easily the best part of the book.

I don't know what took me so long to discover why he's such a popular author but I'm glad I finally did. Although I must add that once I started reading him I was on a hunt for the rest of the books I was missing, it's impossible not to get engrossed and lost in a slick thriller such as \"Along Came a Spider\" and not crave more. The moment I was done with the 1st book I was all ready dreaming of snatching the 2nd, it was worth to wake up early on Sunday and make a quick run to the bookstore for the next chapter of Alex Cross's life. I usually don't read a series back to back but my mind and appetite were taken hostage and I had to succumb to the calling of another great book. Let me just say how easy it is to have this or his other books spoiled, I didn't read the editorial reviews till after I was done with the story and good thing too, I felt that some of the surprising moments were being dangerously close to being mentioned. This highly suspenseful story begins with a kidnapping from the past that inspires future psychopaths; the famous Lindenberg baby is snatched from his crib, to be buried alive. This becomes the inspiration for Gary Murphy and the evolution of his alter ego Gary Soneji - ruthless kidnapper and killer with over two hundred victims on his black soul. Gary wants to be somebody, he wants the streets to hum and buzz with terror at the very thought of his name, he's also an exceptional planner who's ideas take years to plan and without leaving any prints or traces of his true identity. He's the master of disguises and faux credentials that let him slip into many sectors unnoticed, and watch his future victims. Gary decides to act on his master plan and kidnap two prominent children from their highly guarded school. The ransom is in millions but sometimes Gary likes the mental and physical torture more than money, he lives and breathes on inflicting terror on men, women and anything that will cross his way, especially children. He's trilled at the thought that the famous Alex Cross is on his tail, and he does his best to taunt and stalk the man, leaving him more crimes to solve. Just when things start to come to light another devious plot exudes a foul stench, a warning that the case if far from being over, one that puts a real spin on the story. I cannot say any more, this book is best read with knowing the smallest bit of detail because so much happens and not all turns out well for Cross. For a five hundred page book this reads extremely fast, I was done with it in two days and if my eye balls weren't revolting I would have read something right after it but they needed a break. It's quite enjoyable to read a juicy book that doesn't let go and one that ends with a bang, now I see why so many people read and like Patterson, he's pretty awesome. - Kasia S.</td><td>Beware of the sticky web of deceit</td><td>1240185600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-04-20</td><td>Mon </td><td>Apr</td><td>40</td><td>27</td><td>201</td><td>562</td></tr><tr><td>73431</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A8YDXMFXJ4R6X</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amber</td><td>Good movie to watch, but not really all that engaging.

Comparing Along Came a Spider to A Farewell To Arms is like comparing a Mozart symphony to current pop music. That said, you will find a pretty good crime thriller that you can run through in a couple days. That's the reason the work is a massive bestseller. I thought the plot was compelling but, even at 500+ pages, I didn't really feel that much for the victims. Patterson devotes much more development time to the \"bad guys\". Also, superfluous writing crops up every now and then. For example, I remember one part where a criminal says something along the lines of: \"Believe whatever the hell you want.\" Then after that quote, we get this profound commentary from the narrator: \"He didn't care what I thought.\" Well, obviously! Not a major problem, but it comes across as a little amateur. Still, even after those criticisms, I did mostly enjoy the book. If you're looking for a quick, easy read with some interesting twists, I say go for it.

Actor Morgan Freeman does best in films where he's the likable hero-cop. He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many \"oh, come on's\" said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible. For a tough modern-day crime story this film, for the most part, was pretty low- key with low profanity and not a lot of gore or overdone action. That was surprising considering the sordid subject matter. The tameness in here, and the quality of Freeman's acting, make this a small notch above the average thriller.</td><td>Slightly Above Average</td><td>1247097600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-07-09</td><td>Thu </td><td>Jul</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>206</td><td>151</td></tr><tr><td>73426</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3LJSF0LV5QRYT</td><td>0006476155</td><td>woodrow locksley</td><td>I have a brother who is really interestedin crime fiction and he has spoken highly of this series so I read the books not in order however. this is where you should start.the murderer is an intersting villain but it is the characterization of Cross his hrandmother and his best friend John Sampson that maid this book compelling and led me to read the rest of the series even though it shows the signs of a beginner in being overwritten at times despite the short chapters</td><td>decent first novel in series</td><td>1249603200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-08-07</td><td>Fri </td><td>Aug</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>207</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>73422</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AN05NDW56HNMH</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Melanie Zamarripa</td><td>James Patterson is one of my favorite writers.

Edmund</td><td>Along Came a Spider is probably the epitome of what every crime-thriller novel should be. At 500 pages its easy to devour reading, the suspense is well balanced, but the real key to success is Alex Cross himself. Alex is a black, detective with a degree in psychology, who is passionate about his work, volunteers at a food bank and counsels on the side. And he isn't perfect, he loses his head and punches out racists, doesn't spend enough time at home with his kids and is a bit of a sucker for the ladies. The plot of the novel is pretty basic, but flows well, the first half reads like a standard serial killer case, the pace does slow a little in the second half as deeper intrigue is revealed. As a psychology major I like Alex's brief discussions about psyc, although I find his use of hypnotism dubious (but hey this was the early ninties not 2010) The love scenes are a little clumsy, particularly a steamy bath scene which kinda failed to interest. Most surprising was the ending (I'll try not to spoil anything) where one of the crooks gets their punishment. I found it oddly touching and poignant.

This is my first James Patterson novel and boy what a novel this is. How many twists and turns you can keep in a novel.

I had seen this movie but I don't think I had ever read the book. The case was compelling and the twist (even though I knew it was coming) still kind of caught me off guard. James Patterson truly has a way of sucking you into a story and never quite knowing which way he is going to turn. What I Liked: The pacing was a little off in this book but with that in mind I liked how each new element of the book was introduced. I also like how no storyline was dropped and forgotten. It was interesting to read the physical characteristics of the characters because they were a little off from what I thought they would look like so I had to adjust my mental images of the main characters. Complaints: None Movie Comparison Thoughts: Physically I don't think any of the casting matched the actual characters in the book---that being said I think everyone did a great job in their roles. I know these are older movies but as thrillers I think they have stood the test of time. Why I gave it a 4: I didn't like it as much as Kiss the Girls (I seldom like book 1 in a series as much as the rest of the series) but it was still a really good read. Who would I recommend it too: Thriller/Mystery fans.

The suspense is there when needed, and the twists come and go with intended impact and yet, when all is said and done I can't seem to really care to see the film again.  I think maybe that has to do with the fact that, while it does everything with fine effect, it doesn't do anything `special'.  `Along Came a Spider' is a decent crime-thriller that sports a fine performance from Morgan Freeman (who could very easily have phoned this in and yet he surprisingly doesn't) and a clever twist here and there, but that is all.  I much preferred the films predecessor, which is actually a sequel to this film (`Kiss the Girls') which, while certainly teetering on the generic in certain respects, contained a savagely sincere performance from Ashley Judd that elevated the film immensely.  `Along Came a Spider' doesn't equal that intensity.

I've never been an enormous fan of James Patterson's style and the way he chooses to flesh out the skeletons of his plotlines. But the plotlines themselves are the best and most intricate in the business.  This book in particular, along with Kiss the Girls, provides some of the most well-developed and complex storyline labyrinths in the murder / detective genre. Patterson always seems to have a way to detract from his own incredible plots with some cheesy writing, and continually brings his books from five stars to four in this manner...  But four stars is nothing to sneeze at. Another fast-paced and compelling read from the pen of James Patterson.</td><td>Writing Style is occasionally ho-hum but Patterson is the Master of Plot</td><td>1325980800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2012-01-08</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jan</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>237</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>73379</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AE5TIR7VRQAYD</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Leslie</td><td>While on medical leave from work I sat down to read one of Patterson's books and ended up reading the entire Alex Cross & Women's Murder Club series in 2 weeks!!

The plot, the events, and actions were very well done.  I was surprised and pleased.  The book definitely kept my interest.  The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't smile.  I think of Grisham who takes me to the 5 star level.  He writes a similar genre, but he makes me smile, either at the intriguing characters, or the \"wow that is so exciting\" when being chased or trapped or wondering if the hero will survive. At times I felt impatient to get some answers.  The result was it felt a little slow.  I've read other police procedural mysteries that had me less impatient and enjoying the journey more. The narrator Charles Turner was fine, but I wish Morgan Freeman had narrated.  The character Alex Cross is a black man from the south.  Morgan played Alex in the movie, and I kept thinking about him.  He would have been a great narrator. The story is told in first person from Alex's point of view and then third person for other characters and events.  That structure worked ok, but I would have preferred third person for all.  When he switches to first person, I am almost taken out of the story, thinking of myself - my perspective. DATA: Unabridged audiobook reading time: 12 hrs and 21 mins.  Violence: strong.

He finds himself being forced into a kidnapping case when the kidnapper plants evidence in Alex's mailbox that makes him look like the kidnapper. The teacher, Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), works at an elite school for the privileged children of many international figures and the heads of countries.  He has plans that involve multiple kidnappings and the Secret Service and the child's parents wants Alex to help solve the case...... This movie is a thriller and a well thought through storyline that will hold your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat.  It features an excellent cast and the acting in this film is very good.  The story is based on the book written by James Patterson.  The story line has changed but it contains multiple twists and plot changes that will keep you guessing who are the bad guys and who are the good guys.

The gook can be read as a standalone book or you can continue on in the series. I'm looking forward to the series. What kept the book from being great is that the romance portion was rather predictable and somewhat unbelievable given the personality of the main character. I think developing romantic relationships in suspense books is very tricky and needs to be done lightly and not rushed - most authors don't do this aspect very well. I also anticipated how the book would end and who was involved and it would have been nice to be completely shocked by the ending.</td><td>Good, But Not Great</td><td>1350172800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2012-10-14</td><td>Sun </td><td>Oct</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>262</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>73351</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3E2U21OE35O73</td><td>0006476155</td><td>loves to read</td><td>Great condition for a book that is over 10 years old.

Kirk</td><td>Alex Cross is an articulate, educated black man who is a homicide detective Washington D.C. police department. He just needs to be in a better novel. In this debut novel that features said character, Cross is put on a case to find two, white, wealthy kids abducted from a private school. This bothers him somewhat as he was on a case where two black children are missing, and yet no law officials seem interested. The villain of the piece is Gary Soneji, who masqueraded as an instructor of the private school; he is your typical psycho who is also brilliant and wants to be remembered throughout history. (These types of villains showed up a lot in the films of the 1990s). Cross meets a beautiful, blonde, white FBI agent named Jezzie whom he has a relationship with, and gets serious with...only that he finds out that she (in a confusing plot turn) had something to do with the two abducted white children. She was only faking a relationship with Cross to get police information from him; Jezzie and two other officers (also in a confusing plot turn) somehow took charge of the abducting operation of the private school children. Cross, in an unrealistic manner, catches Jezzie by going back to an island they traveled to early in the novel, having people placed strategically in places as if he had clairvoyance that Jezzie would 1. Come back with him to the island. 2. They would travel the exact way where his people would be waiting. 3. Jezzie would say exactly what he needed to know in order to have evidence to arrest her, and her cohorts. Interestingly, Jezzie is the one who is given the death penalty, and Soneji is not....(only hinting from his cell that he will be back). Moreover, it is said that Soneji had something to do with the missing black kids as well! Now, as aforementioned, I am familiar with the film adaptation of this novel; and, that wasn't an improvement. It was actually worse. Both the film and the novel it was based on is confusing, convoluted, and generic or cliched...not too mention unrealistic with how certain things automatically fall into place, or how the main character has - as aforementioned - plot clairvoyance. I do plan on reading the next entry, `Kiss the Girls,' and I hope there is an improvement.</td><td>Meh...*possible spoilers*</td><td>1363651200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-03-19</td><td>Tue </td><td>Mar</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>340</td><td>396</td></tr><tr><td>73227</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A35LNZEWPISIWX</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Linus&#039;s mom</td><td>Awesome book!

Huston</td><td>\"Along Came A Spider\" is an okay installment to the Alex Cross series in my eyes.  I think that it is overrated, but I do think that it is okay for being the first. The writing is good and the characters are interesting.  Patterson does a great job introducing the main character, Alex Cross himself, in a fitting way.  But the best parts are when we see him with his family.  And his kids are so adorable.  Janelle and Damon make me want to see them more.  Including Nana Mama, who I just love seeing getting into arguments with Alex.  Other characters like John, Jezzie, and Soneji I actually like.  The mystery is done well too. But this novel has its problems.  The romance between Alex and Jezzie feels a little forced (despite that there is some development).  The final twist at the end really makes me angry.  I won't give anything major away, but it deals with Jezzie and I really hate what Patterson did to her.  I love Jezzie as a character.  It didn't sit well with me.  Even the time jumps feel out of place.  They don't go back and forth or anything, they just skip a couple of weeks or months, which made the pacing of the novel itself feel a little to slow.  Soneji's character didn't get the attention that I was hoping for in the end.  In fact, the ending itself felt a little to depressing. In the end, despite its problems I might have with it, this novel works out fine and it makes me excited for Alex's next adventure.  I say it is worth reading and buying.</td><td>A nice way to kick off the series.</td><td>1368748800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-05-17</td><td>Fri </td><td>May</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>416</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>73144</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3QULF5AQ51ZX0</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>First James Patterson book.

The man, Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), has been working as a teacher of computer science at the school and the girl, Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), is the daughter of a U.S. Senator Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty). Megan has a close relationship with another pupil at the school, Dmitri Starodubov (Anton Yelchin), son of the Russian President. Megan and Dmitri, both gifted children, have worked out a computer code for communicating with each other class and sending secret messages between them when they are supposed to be working. Secret Service agent Jazzie Flanigan (Monica Potter) is held responsible for the kidnapping as her specific assignment was to protect Megan. Soneji seems to be intent upon mirroring the famous 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's infant son. But it seems that Soneji is also intent upon kidnapping Dmitri, but is foiled by Cross. Cross pays a ransom for release of the girl but when the two confront each other, Soneji claims to know nothing of the ransom. I won't disclose the outcome. This is an ingenious and gripping plot with several twists and turns and very well acted by all the principals.</td><td>A gripping and well-acted thriller</td><td>1370131200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-06-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jun</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>426</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>73129</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A5DVX3B075B09</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Patricia Young</td><td>Morgan Freeman and action movies are pretty well a pair of winners.

Osier</td><td>Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist as well as a Washington, D.C. police detective. He's also a black man whose wife was murdered several years ago, leaving him with two small children to rear - thankfully not alone. His grandmother, a formidable retired educator whom Alex calls Nana Mama because after his mother's early death he knew no other parent, lives with the family and takes care of the children. When two nasty murder cases involving black families come his way, Alex wants to catch the killer even more passionately than usual. But before he really gets the investigation underway, two white children are kidnapped from an exclusive private school when they were supposed to be under Secret Service protection. Thanks to the unwanted fame brought to him by a recent news article, the mayor orders Cross pulled off the murder cases and assigned to the kidnapping. Cross is his best, the public surely believes, and the mayor must be seen giving this case his best. For its victims are the young daughter of a film star, and the young son of the Secretary of the Treasury. Cross doesn't want to investigate a kidnapping for ransom whose victims need him a lot less, in his opinion, than the black families who will likely become the deranged killer's next targets. His resistance gets him nowhere with the mayor. But as he works on the kidnapping, however unwillingly, he comes to know the Secret Service supervisory agent on whose watch it happened; and before he knows it, widower Alex Cross is falling in love with a most unsuitable partner. A beautiful white woman in the same dangerous business. The cases he wants to investigate can't possibly be connected with the kidnapping that he thinks someone else can and should handle. Or can they? The more he learns, the less he feels that he really knows. Has the brilliant Alex Cross finally met his match, in a criminal even more intelligent and driven than he is? This is a scary book indeed, and not due to excessive gore. It's got some of that, yes; but the worst of its terrors are psychological, as Cross pursues a psychopath. I'm told this is the first book in a series, and after it kept me awake until the wee hours of this morning I find myself eager to get my hands on the next installment.

More than one of the reviews on here mentions 'Smartly written' and 'Supurb' I question where their bar of judgement is. 3 prime examples (there are many more) are: 1- This serial killer did his first job at 12. Later in the book it refers back to this (from the killer's perspective/POV) and he is looking back on it SIXTY years ago. Simple math (apparently not done by the editors, writer, or any praiseworthy readers) puts our serial killer at 72 years old. And this 72 year old man bests kids at video games and kills an FBI agent with a knife in hand combat? -Get real. 2- Yeah, we get it, Alex Cross is black. Does it really need to be mentioned on every single page? Was race the major motivator in this story? Seems like it was more of a focus than plot. Does it really matter what race he is? 3- No matter how good Alex Cross might be at his job, a detective mouthing off to the police chief and the *Mayor* keeps his job and is allowed to say things like F__ you to his superiors? Unrealistic!

I LOVE Morgan Freeman. He's one of my all-time favorite actors, but he had no business playing Alex Cross. Alex Cross is supposed to be this young, sexy beefcake cop who happens to have a doctorate in psychology. They should have gotten Will Smith or Denzel Washington at the least to play this part. While I adore Mr. Freeman and his acting, he's most assuredly not in the \"beefcake\" category. Not by a longshot. The rest of the acting is so-so. As a mystery the plot is lukewarm at best, and the whole movie just lacked that \"certain something\" that made it in any way suspenseful.

The story opens with a prologue regarding the infamous kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby in 1932, as explained through the thoughts of the 12-year old kidnapper.  It then jumps to 1992, and introduces Alex Cross, who is a brilliant Homicide detective and psychologist, his partner, John Sampson, and his delightful grandmother, Nana Mama.  As the story unfolds, Alex and his partner are called to a triple homicide scene where a mother, daughter, and 3-year old boy have been brutally murdered; a similar murder has just previously occurred, and Cross suspects this is just the beginning of a rash of serial murders in the poorest part of town targeting blacks.  Cross is determined to solve the murders, even though those in management at the police department regard these murders as unimportant because they involve the poor.  While at the murder scene, Cross is called to a private school where a famous actress' daughter and the son of the Secretary of the Treasury have been kidnapped by a man posing as a teacher at the school, Gary Soneji.  Cross is told that the kidnappings are high-priority, and he resents the fact that two rich kids take precedence over six murders of innocent, albeit poor, black victims.  Patterson does an excellent job of merging the two scenarios as Cross investigates and works to solve both of the crimes. For those unfamiliar with the Alex Cross series, this book is the one to read first; it explains the background of the characters while weaving them through a very suspenseful tale with many unexpected twists and turns.  Patterson makes the characters seem believable and real; readers will be kept on the edge of their seats, and will admit that the only drawback of the novel is that it ends.  Most suspense/thriller aficionados will waste no time picking up the next book in the series. This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.</td><td>Along Came a Spider</td><td>1377734400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-08-29</td><td>Thu </td><td>Aug</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>476</td><td>364</td></tr><tr><td>72997</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AU0ZV3WDS6JGS</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Rita</td><td>Our family really enjoyed this \"older movie\" - James Patterson's work is truely untimeless!  yet another great work for all to enjoy!</td><td>Morgan Freeman - Great as always</td><td>1377907200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-08-31</td><td>Sat </td><td>Aug</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>477</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>72995</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3QLK316Q2AU12</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Kindle Customer</td><td>One of James Patterson's best novels and I was moved into the story with a new understanding of James Patterson's work.

The whole novel is about a whole team of people who are working hard to find the kids. Patterson switches points of view every few chapters so that the reader can see the story unravel from other perspectives, not just the main character's. I personally loved the book. I feel that the author kept enough details hidden to the point that the reader would be mind blown when they were revealed. Many people don't really like the writing style that James Patterson uses in his books, but I personally do. I have to admit, I have read many other James Patterson books, and I have loved them all. The only problem I have with this particular book is where he talks about how one of the character's wives died. In other books in this series (I am ashamed to admit that I read this series out of order before discovering my mistake) he gives a different account on how she died.</td><td>Along Came A Spider by James Patterson</td><td>1378339200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-05</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>482</td><td>207</td></tr><tr><td>72988</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A27RJ55JALREQ8</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Quite a thriller..You don't need to worry about your attention span because the action never stops...Try it you will like it..</td><td>Great movie</td><td>1378339200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-05</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>483</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>72986</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3BKGW9HSU2B9G</td><td>0006476155</td><td>T-Weeder Tool</td><td>Great movie.

Patterson got famous for his plotting skills, and his mastery of this element shows in this work.  The pacing is fast, the tension is constantly high, and the surprises keep on coming. 2) Characters (4 stars) - Alex Cross is not just a Dirty Harry, he is also thoughtful and sensitive and perceptive.  Gary Soneji is not just a raving psychopath, he is also a calculating enigma.  Jezzie is not just a simple love interest, she also has a mystery of her own.  All these characters could have been one-dimensional and the story would still have worked.  But they weren't, and for me that really elevated this book above the ranks of the traditional thriller. 3) Theme (2 stars) - This book is so much about the charging plot of trying to solve a kidnapping mystery that messages or morals really take a back seat.  There did seem to be one, though, about how the lust for fame will make people do crazy things, as personified by the villain, but this theme wasn't explored much deeper than the surface level. 4) Voice (4 stars) - Yes, Patterson is an easy read.  But (at least in this work) I didn't find that skill of easiness to come with the usual trappings of 8th grade diction and clich.  His sentences reflect the POV of the chapter lead, and they do a great job conveying the mood and characters' psyche while also telling a fast paced tale. 5) Setting (4 stars) - Washington DC is the locus of events, but the action seeps out up and down the Eastern Seaboard.  Patterson does a good job describing each scene in just enough detail to transport you there, but not too much to slow the ride. 6) Overall (4 stars) - The main reason you read a Patterson novel is the plot, and that element doesn't disappoint here.  But I was also pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and the prose.  I'd recommend it.</td><td>Plot - 5, Characters - 4, Theme - 2, Voice - 4, Setting - 4, Overall - 4</td><td>1378944000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-12</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>486</td><td>385</td></tr><tr><td>72980</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ALGQI8XRHWTKP</td><td>0006476155</td><td>James Sharrar</td><td>Taut.

I recommend reading this first if you are embarking on reading the Alex Cross series.  Mr. Patterson does a good job of making each book stand on it's own, but Alex is more raw and real in the first one than in some of the later books.  This is also one of the better books of the series.  If you haven't read Patterson before he has a style of short chapters, straightforward sentences and a fairly linear train of thought through the book.  This makes for quick reading and easy reading  which is helpful if you only get to read in short bursts between other activities.</td><td>Good First of Series</td><td>1379203200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-15</td><td>Sun </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>488</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>72968</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A39DIW9IN23IH8</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Valerie, Ohio</td><td>I bought every book in this series because after I read the first one, I just waned more!

This series is a murder mystery/ cop drama kind of series and is definitly at the top of it's genre.  It is not for the younger audience or the very tender hearted as it has graphic literary imagery.  It puts you in the mind set of TV shows like Rizoli and Isles, Law and Order, CSI, and Major Crimes in the sense of type of series and graphic crimes but its focus on one detective, his cases, his life and his family makes it a more personal look at the crime and solving of it.

We bought it because we have faith in Morgan Freeman's talent and he didn't let us down. The edge-of-your-seat suspense is there from the very first frame and never lets up. At the very beginning, detective Alex Patterson loses his partner in an excruciatingly realistic scene that leaves him feeling a painful responsibility for her death. He tries to retire, but is drawn into the case of a kidnapped child. There is a surprising twist and a satisfing happy ending. Violence, but no graphic sex or excessive swearing.</td><td>Suspense, plus heart</td><td>1379548800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-19</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>493</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>72959</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A259J5W119JB7T</td><td>0006476155</td><td>uboo</td><td>This book was very exciting from beginning to end is a great read for anyone who loves Alex Cross.watch the movie several times but the book is nothing like the movie.

Simply put, while Secret Service operatives assigned to protect important people may have their flaws, greed isn't credibly one of them; the work doesn't attract people who are in it for the money. Finally, while I usually dislike TV and films where children are threatened, the victim here is spectacular: smart and resourceful. I actually enjoyed watching her foil her kidnappers.  Advice?

I've continued to purchase them as they are released and my wife has read them all, so I decided that the best thing to do was to start over from the beginning. This was actually the second Alex Cross (and James Patterson) book that I read. For some reason, I read Kiss the Girls shortly after it's release. I distinctly remembered that Along Came a Spider had a very different feel from Kiss the Girls and most of Patterson's later works. Turns out, I remembered correctly. Along Came a Spider still has a lot of the Patterson feel to it, but it seems to move at a bit slower pace than his subsequent novels. Don't get me wrong there is still plenty of action and lots of plot twists, it just seems that Patterson let's things take a little more time to develop. Overall, I thought that it was a really good book. Patterson's works will never be mistaken for high-brow literature, but they are fun to read and you never quite know where he's going to take you. This novel does a great job of introducing Alex Cross & Co. and the villain is one of his best.</td><td>My Review</td><td>1385942400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-12-02</td><td>Mon </td><td>Dec</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>518</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>72910</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A16SNT32UNOG90</td><td>0006476155</td><td>C David Brown</td><td>Morgan Freeman has yet to take on a dull or dead role.

However, the movie simply deviates too much from its source material to truly merit the description of \"adaptation\".  While the plot of the movie was good and its cast was superb (isn't Morgan Freeman always?), this film might have done better in my eyes had it not been adapted from the novel of the same name to begin with.  Ultimately, they don't share much apart from the character names and a few plot details.  I do understand that a movie must take certain liberties with its source material, especially a novel, as there are time constraints.  But so much that made this novel great was cut out and, in many cases, replaced by plot devices which probably did not take up more or less time than the original.  Perhaps this was a book that would have been best served by a movie split into two parts (i.e. like the 7th Harry Potter book.)  As a general crime thriller, I say it's far above average mostly thanks to its casting choices, but I feel so much more could have been done with it even if it weren't an adaptation.  As for my recommendation, I do recommend it to anyone who's a fan of crime thrillers with a decent plot and a great cast.  For all the James Patterson/Alex Cross fans out there, I'll leave it up to you.

ALONG CAME A SPIDER is a gem.  It is a world class highly sophisticated thriller for the ages.  It is a heart stopping thrill ride of the imagination, a ride into darkness so deep you won't know which direction is up. The emotions of the reader are guaranteed to run high when two celebrity children are kidnapped, and when it turns out they are held by a mass murdering psychopath, your eyes and your hands are guaranteed to be glued to your kindle for the duration of the read. We are introduced to the legendary and brilliant Washington Detective, Alex Cross.  His wife was killed in a drive-by shooting three years ago but he is still grieving.  His partner, John Sampson, is a life long friend.  Cross and his two children are living with his grandmother who still volunteers at the local primary school.  Cross the man has an incredible career - and amazing potential -  ahead of him and given his background, he is understandably happy to stay (in Washington) where he feels he can achieve the most for the common good.  But there are people above him who can see his talents and intelligence (he has a PhD in Psychology) and are consequently pushing him toward higher things.  So there is tension on several levels in this fine, fine tome. The kidnapper is a lunatic. Seriously.  Mr Gary Soneji is a mass murdering delusionist who kills for the fun and self imposed glory of it all. After slashing the throat of a high powered member of the FBI, the reader finds him crying out for a challenge in his life.  Well, guess what buddy!  Alex Cross is about to give you a challenge you will never forget! We also meet 24 year old blonde bombshell and secret service agent, Jezzie Flanagan, who comes to work everyday on a high powered black BMW sports motorbike.  She too is a highly qualified cast member of the story and those in the know recognise her for what she is.  A player. And so to the writing.  It is beautifully balanced, with excellent building of suspense and tension as you progress through the story.  The characters are fantastically created and each have their own set of histories.  The book itself has longer and deeper chapters than the newer releases from the world famous writer and the book feels more solid as a result.  The language is strong - another difference from the newer books but given the setting of the characters and their histories, I guess the reader can overlook this.  The book is violent.  It certainly is not funny.  That would be totally ridiculous.  There are moments of poignancy and emotion scattered like grains of chalk across an empty blackboard.  It has an excellent feel and will make the reader deeply, deeply satisfied at the end. And so to the ending.  It is quite extraordinary.  It is multi-directional with twists and turns. And chops and changes.  You won't know where to look except for at the white of your kindle screen, or the psperback you sre holding.  And the final chapter is exquisitely thrilling, exciting and nail biting.  A final moment of poignancy finishes this classic thriller of the 1990s and you will find yourself a little sad at book's end.  Another true sign of greatness.  At least there are 20 more books to read. I think i have said enough.  This is one of the modern day classics of the genre and i consider myself privileged to have come across it so long after it was released.  The world owes it thanks to James Patterson for giving us such a fantastic tale and yet another superhero to stand up against the evils that exist in our world.

This one takes it nearly as far as it can go. Here's the scoop. The young daughter of a U.S. Senator has been kidnapped. Famed detective Alex Cross is reluctantly brought in. The kidnapper has left some clever clues which Alex, and his secret service partner whose negligence led to the kidnapping, need to follow to retrieve the girl. Surprises abound in the investigation. Overall this is pretty good. It's a major studio release with good production values and a fine cast. Directing, editing, music score are all on par with the budget. I guess I had a problem with the fact that our kidnapper ( the always good Michael Wincott) was so darned clever. Someone would need to be a member of MENSA to figure out these clues. Then, way into the third act there were a couple of 180 degree turns that nearly took my head off. I like a good surprise as much as the next person but these just seemed too much for me. This is an okay watch. It's diverting and entertaining. Just forgive it its weaknesses.</td><td>He Came. He Crawled.

Very vague on what happened to money.  Much of the story left \"incomplete\" in my opinion.  Also struggled with the bruises described as being sustained AFTER death.  As far as I know, that wouldn't have happened unless the \"beating\" happened at the time of death or very shortly thereafter.  Not after finding him already dead.  Still really enjoyed reading it though and look forward to Alex's next adventure.

It it not too often that I can find a psychological mystery to be this exceptional.  The Gary Soneji/Murphy out smarting the police with being a psychopath, potential Multiple personality disorder/ personality fatigue, and being the actor with having homicidal \"1 year/5 year/lifetime plans\" to be famous like he feels he should be is very interesting.  From what I heard (without reading any other Alex cross books), this book will set up for some storylines in the next few books allowing for some interesting storylines for the book now. This book series is the Law and Order: Criminal Intent series of James Patterson.  While the story revolves around the crime and solving the crime, there is a huge element to the psychological, motives and the \"criminal intent\".  It involves the \"ticking\" of the criminal to why they would do the things they would do.  It can range from money to famous to just being a pure psychological evil driven madman.  All in all an A+. In this book by itself, there is one drawback.  It can be really slow sometimes.  After Soneji's trial and conviction (about half way through) starting with part 4, it starts dragging while Alex Cross continues the case.  But it does lead up to a very interesting ending (the last few chapters), in which I will be willing to give it a pass.

He volunteers at a soup kitchen in his neighborhood. He's devoted to his two kids, his grandmother, and the memory of his dead wife. He's in great shape and good looking... Alex will go through a lot of turmoil in this book, and he always has our sympathy. Even the psychopath he's hunting finds something attractive about Alex. Alex is the one he most enjoys playing mind games with, and sharing his twisted fantasies with. The crimes in the story are horrific and not for the squeamish. But the villain of the piece is a fascinating character -- maybe a split personality, maybe just a master manipulator, but certainly a master-criminal since boyhood. Long-range planning of nightmarish deeds is his specialty. There's plenty of action throughout, and a shocking twist at the end. This is my first experience of James Patterson, and I'm impressed. I've ordered the next Alex Cross novel.

Due to deeper character development, I probably prefer the book, which I read first,  to the movie but no doubt production time restraints would necessitate some changes. No spoiler alerts here, I won't reveal any differences between the two in case you want to read and/or watch for yourself. I highly recommend reading the book and seeing the movie, in either order you prefer. I will say there are twists and turns in both plus a surprising -- and heartbreaking -- ending that you'll wish didn't happen in both versions. However, there are \"subtle clues\" about it in both the movie and in the book if you're paying close attention! And while the book and the movie end differently, the result is the same; so read the book and watch the movie: you'll find out what I mean. And watch the movie at least twice to see where those sneaky clues were if you missed them the first time. The acting is superb. I can think of no one better to portray Psychiatrist/Profiler/ Detective Alex Cross than Morgan Freeman. He is smart, determined, self-controlled and totally believable in this role. The man exudes \"smarts.\" You can see the gears turning in Morgan Freeman's head as he pieces together clue after clue. There is one scene in particular where you can literally see him \"light up\" when he figures out an all-too-important password. The viewer has confidence in him that he will ultimately outwit everyone, including the bad guys, and blow the case wide open, which he does to everyone's dismay during the film's shocking ending. Monica Potter is an amazing \"emotional\" actress. By that I mean this lady can make you feel her character's pain as well as turn on the tears. [Anyone who did not see her performance in \"Parenthood\" where she wept during her goodbye to a dying friend should watch it on YouTube. It's some of the best acting I've ever seen. And Ms. Potter's realistic characterization of a woman fighting breast cancer on that same show is beyond incredible. No other actress compares to her in my opinion.] In this film she plays Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan, sort of a tag-along partner to Alex Cross. Cross is kind to her and we see a softer side of Cross as he plays devil's advocate for Jezzie after the Senator's daughter she is assigned to protect is kidnapped at a private school. Jezzie beats herself up emotionally over that and also over another blunder she makes later in the film, but the kind and super-intelligent Psychiatrist-Detective Alex Cross boosts Jezzie's ego, lending her both moral support and friendship. They are very good together onscreen. Monica Potter brings out her character's intelligence, humanness and flaws seamlessly. She can handle her firearm too! Again, I can't think of anyone who could have portrayed the character of Jezzie Flannigan any better than Monica Potter. She is young and beautiful and a very skilled actress. I could watch her scenes with Morgan Freeman time and again, and I have. Perfection. Michael Wincott is chilling as the maniacal kidnapper who provides just the right amount of edginess and danger to his character, Gary Soneji. While this character is much more fully developed -- and deadly -- in the book, he is both dangerous enough and smart enough on film to kidnap the Senator's child from her school right from under Jezzie Flannigan's nose: let the cat and mouse games begin between Soneji and Cross/Flannigan. There are plenty of twists and turns in this plot to keep you interested. Mr. Wincott portrays his character with touches of danger and psychosis, making you believe he really is a serial killer! However, this movie character is far less dangerous than the character in the book but that does not make Mr. Wincott any less menacing by any means. Well done. Mika Boorem is simply wonderful as the abducted child. This young lady does an incredible job of showing grit and determination in the face of fear and certain death by her captors. Her acting skills are well beyond her years. Mika Boorem gets to express a range of emotions from trust and love for her Secret Service guardian, Jezzie Flannigan, to confidence in, then apprehension of, her teacher and kidnapper, Gary Soneji. During the film's final tense moments we see Mika bring out the child's cleverness as she fearfully tries to elude and outwit one very bad sociopath determined to kill her. Miss Boorem's character has limited dialog but she plays the terrified yet brainy kidnapped child very well. Kudos to her. Fabulous stuff! An excellent supporting cast includes Michael Moriarity, Penelope Ann Miller and several more. They all are in fine form although Mr. Moriarity's attempt at portraying [perhaps a southern] Senator was a bit \"strained.\" Direction and camera angles are spot on as well in my opinion. Some of my favorite director's scenes are a sequence shot on a train, a \"ransom run\" through D.C., the one of Morgan Freeman in that \"light bulb\" moment, as well as one of Monica Potter's interactions with the child actress, Mika Boorem, late in the film. There are a couple of other fine shots that I liked very much: one of Cross and Flannigan arriving at a crime scene, their vehicle approaching from a distance, then a nice shot of the same vehicle just exiting a marvelous curved bridge. This film is rated \"R\" for violence and language; however, it is extremely mild by today's standards. The violence is not gratuitous nor is it glorified and they don't dwell on it. There is some blood but no gore. The language mostly consists of the \"F\" bomb dropped a few times but then not often and there is some short-lived profanity. Filthy talk is a big turn off for me -- both in movies and in real life -- so I'm grateful \"colorful\" language is at a minimum. The bulk of the film runs without it,the worst of it during the tense opening scene. The rest is mostly just straight and pertinent dialog. I would, however, use discretion in permitting youngsters to watch it. There are a few \"mistakes\" in this movie, as in almost all films. They're minor for the most part but there is one glaring error that you might notice if you're listening closely. I have an eye and ear for detail so I usually readily spot gaffs most people miss. However, it's all small stuff and certainly doesn't detract from the film, the acting or the story in any way. [A challenge: for fun, see if you catch them while you're watching.] I found this film extremely entertaining, well done and well acted. Though I had already read the book, as noted above, I found it a fascinating take on the story and it kept me engrossed to the bitter [literally] end. I have watched it twice and will view it time and again I'm sure. I'm glad to have it in my DVD collection. Watch carefully and enjoy.</td><td>A superb roller coaster ride of suspense and twists!</td><td>1405728000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-07-19</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>654</td><td>1196</td></tr><tr><td>72764</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ABP5LUZQ1NXND</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Donald Couture</td><td>Another in a well written series of books featuring Alex Cross.

Of course, they usually are. Several things are left out of the movie that are in the book, and i feel, are important to the whole series. I've read the first 16 or so of the Alex Cross series and they are good. Very easy to read, and makes you want to see what happens to Alex and his family. They aren't edge-of-your-seat thrilling, but still a great read. I originally began reading these because I saw the movies (Kiss the Girls and then Along Came a Spider) and realized they were based off of the books, and decided to read them. Of course, the books are much better than the movies. I haven't seen the latest Alex Cross movie with Tyler Perry and I'm not sure how I feel about Tyler Perry playing Alex Cross. If you're into a series of books, these are a great time killer.

He therefore decided to bridge the gap, so to speak, and undertake this momentous task himself.  In so far as it is possible for someone to adequately accomplish this Herculean task of being both comprehensive and somewhat concise (the material is indeed covered in one volume, though 831 pages long), Roy Porter has succeeded.   Porter has an eye for the unusual, spicing up his reporting with examples of odd concoctions and practices used for various maladies down through the ages, such as the use of pulverized crocodile dung, various herbs, and honey as a contraceptive pessary among the ancient Egyptians, or the English resistance against legal revisions (including town sewer reform among other things) attempting to fight cholera in the 19th century: \"We prefer to take our chances with cholera and the rest rath! er than be bullied into health,\" reported THE TIMES.  Most refreshingly, he is not timid in rendering pronouncements for both good and ill on the medical profession, bringing a candor needed to assess the impact of medicine down through the ages.  He is thorough without being tedious, educational without being pedantic, and has a fine eye for comedy without being flippant.   As someone with an interest in history and by vocation a surgeon, I found Roy Porter's book a delightfully instructive volume to read.  I look forward to returning to peruse it many times in the years ahead.</td><td>Superb Medical History in One Volume</td><td>902016000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>1998-08-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Aug</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>1</td><td>266</td></tr><tr><td>17238</td><td>4.0</td><td>9</td><td>true</td><td>A1TAU5R8BSLKTC</td><td>0002151731</td><td>some guy on the internet</td><td>There is a solid narrative history of the up to 1800 or so and then he gives extended essays on a variety of topics like surgery, tropical medicine or public medicine.

I got as far as page 34 before I concluded that this book was never going to live up to its promise and was, in fact, a Marxist  polemic.  The book does does say who Roy Porter is, but from the tone of  the book it seems he is one of those trendy journalists (he surely cannot  be a scientist) who detest Western values and particularly Western  science. At page 34 readers are informed that \"the rebirth of the  underclass in the First World (results) from the free-market policies  dominant since the 1980s, (has) assisted the resurgence of disease\".  Oh dear.  This tosh merely reveals Porter's true colours and shows him to  be be short on history but long on leftist cliches.  And it goes downhill  from there.  Shortly after bad health in some of the third world are  attributed to that great leftist bugaboo, colonialism.  The fact that many  dirt poor third world countires got that way through through the  machinations of post-colonial home-grown dictators of a particularly  vicious and evil kind seems to have entirely escaped Porter's  attention. I then skimmed through the rest of the book and similiar  throw-away and absurdly wrong opinions abound.  Later on we are informed  that \"Synthetic food additives and dyes, fertilizers, and pesticides  may all be carcinogenic\".</td><td>A disappointment</td><td>954547200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2000-04-01</td><td>Sat </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>253</td></tr><tr><td>17236</td><td>4.0</td><td>44</td><td>false</td><td>AGG9C66TOLJZB</td><td>0002151731</td><td>A. Woodley</td><td>This is the second review of three I have done of socio-medical histories written of edited by Roy Porter (you can read the others on my reivew page).  I read and compared this to The \"Cambridge Illustrated History: Medicine\", and \"Gout, the Patrician Maladay\". I thought this was the best approach as people might be like me,  looking for a reference work to buy and trying to toss up between which one to get and what the advantages and disadvantages  of one over another. In terms of content I think this is the more comprehensive of the two general reference works. It is over twice the length of Cambridge (over 800 pages in this one compared to not quite 400). It also doesn't have pages taken up with illustrations as Cambridge does. That is probably the thing I like least about this book, there are only three small sections in the middle with some black and white pictures reproduced - I think on comparison I do prefer the slightly more expensive version of having pictures on the pages I am reading for this kind of reference work. The book is divided into 22 chapters which follow the rise of Western medicine more or less chronologically. There are also chapters included on Chinese and Indian Medicine, but expect the emphasis to be European in both history and development. Each chapter is divided into specific topics which are discussed a structure I quite enjoyed as it broke up the text and made it more readable. I looked up some specific subjects to compare this with the Cambrige work and in each case (among them Purperal fever, Galen, Resurrectionists) this book had far more detailed and comprehensive explanations, often citing broad statistics. However writing the a social and medical history of mankind is difficult to do full justice even in 800-some pages. It does give a slightly provide more detail but I wasn't really sure that the slightly greater detail was that much of an advantage to make up for the loss of illustration. In the end this is still only slightly more detail on broad trends rather than in-depth discussion. He does cover some people and subjects not dealt with in \"Cambridge\" including people like Dr James Barry, the first female surgeon (although she was masquerading as a man at the time) - but of course the space available doesn't allow Porter to discuss any of her other significant work as, in terms of forwarding the field of medicine, she was not earth-shattering. Porter has a very good-natured and readable style of writing though and I really enjoyed it. He breaks this chapters up into short sections and interspeses them with rather nice  jokes for instance on page 129 he writes of 'Trotula'said to be a female of 12th century medical school in Salerno but says \" 'Dame Trot' was more likely a male writing in drag.\" So while I very much enjoyed the book and would certainly have no qualms in recommending it to read at all, I do hold some reservations about it - but strictly in comparison with what else is available.</td><td>More a European History</td><td>978912000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-01-08</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jan</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>527</td></tr><tr><td>17235</td><td>2.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>AEP9LH0OOB3EX</td><td>0002151731</td><td>lanoitan</td><td>When I read the NYTimes review of this book I bought it with anxious anticipation.

It's a goal that Roy Porter attempts to make, and he succeeds to some extent. His primary theme is the development of Western Medicine in Europe and America, and as a historical work it is very well done.  He only briefly mentions Eastern medicine and rarely covers \"irregular\" medical practioners except to say that many members of the public subscribe to their folk remedies. What he does well is in his coverage of the breadth of the topic.  There is hardly an historical point he fails to mention, a significant doctor left out, or a disease left undiscussed.  His ability to breathe life into history is exceptional.  In what seems like just the span of a few pages, he has covered a huge swath of history seamlessly. However, the book suffers depth-wise.  There isn't hardly enough space to give deep coverage to every topic and Porter skims past many historical items and persons without a second word.  The book also has the problem of grouping photos and illustrations together far from the textual contexts that they arise from. What is most saddening about the history of medicine is that while we have progressed very far in the understanding of disease, we haven't come very far at all in understanding how to Cure disease.  Porter pushes this point home as the book draws to a close.  What progress has been made has been made primarily in the 20th century with the greater level of technologic progress and antiseptic techniques.  However, despite that, acute diseases that vexed humanity for ages still haunt us and chronic diseases that lay dormant in our genes are coming to the fore.  The future may hold cures for the diseases we suffer from, but if history is any guide, then management of those diseases is a more likely outcome. This book works well as a survey of the history of Western Medicine.

My main point, though, is that the author seems to think that Western medicine is hardly more valid than any of the other alternatives, and his conclusion is that while it has had some successes the result may be that we are about back where we started, with new ailments replacing the old.  The author does not seem to see this as simply an understandable consequence of success.

Yes, this is a mercilessly ample and detailed account of the history of medical thought and practice. It's mercifully non-technical, however, and gracefully written, and certainly worth the labor of reading it if you're at all interested in the history of science. At least seven-eighths of the text is devoted to Western - that is, European-based - medical developments; forgive my bias here, but that's how it should be. There are unquestionably omissions - Thank Aesculapius! - but none that matter much in the sweep of such an encyclopedic narrative. Extremely well-informed readers may find points of contention in it. I didn't, but I'd never claim to be well-informed about medical matters. Some wag has 'tagged' this book on amazon as a 'very short introduction'. Ho ho ho! You may wonder why it took me so long to read this book, given that I pride myself on fast reading. Frankly, I couldn't absorb so much info in a single dosage. I picked the book up and put it down dozens of times, perusing a chapter or a sub-chapter at a time.

Would that I had \"The Greatest Benefit to Mankind\" back then! It seems that Roy Porter's students had the same issue which is what inspired the teacher-turned-author to write this book. Porter's historical account of medicine and healing is fascinating and delves deep to reveal how people's attitudes toward medicine has changed over the years,  including the big breakthroughs. While the book covers a global history, it is primarily European - which is explained by the fact that \"Western medicine has developed in ways which made it uniquely powerful and... uniquely global.\" Sounds a bit like the power of imperialism... The book is a refreshing read and is certainly anything but boring. His tone is comical, engaging, enlightening, and that of a lecturer all at once. Porter has structured his work perfectly and the chapter titles give you the option to quickly look up what you need to know if you're in a hurry. Perfect if you're a student!

Good wasn't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and, sometimes, even strengths.  You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them.  When the hero finally wins his lady's love, it's a timeless moment.

Forced into marriage the next morning to salvage her reputation, she gradually begins to trust the tenderness and respect with which her noble husband eventually wins her. The period detail and writing literally draw you into the story, weaving a lush tapestry against which the splendid romance between the strong heroine and the persistent hero unfolds beautifully. Red Adam is not only patient and kind as he endeavors to win Julitta's affections, but he is strong and intelligent, recognizing in Julitta an equal, worthy partner and giving her full control of the household whenever he must ride out. Facing impudent serving wenches, a resentful chatelaine, an insolent comrade of Red Adam's, and even a thieving cook, Julitta has her hands full with the running of the estate and all its inherent problems, not to mention the whisper of mystery surrounding the former lord. Throw into that brew political unrest and rebellion, raiding Scotts, betrayal and breathtaking escape, and you have a truly dynamic, potent tale. There is just so much more to the story than the above.  A true bond between the characters, genuine affection, and several subplots, all threads being masterfully combined. Any summary is inadequate.  But if you like adventure, a mystery interwoven throughout, compelling history that draws you into its pages, true love in the truest sense, and blazing triumph over adversity, then this is your book!

There is something romantic about a man literally having some sense knocked into him.  Unlike so many romances of the time that had the love interest fight each other to the end then suddenly they are in love, Ms. Ingram gradually brings Julitta from  dislike, to grudging respect, friendship and then love.

Adam takes Julitta back to his keep bent on rape, but the ever resourceful Julitta knocks him out with a stool and when he's sober Adam marries her to assuage her damaged honor. Julitta is none too thrilled with the match, but sparks soon fly between the two as Julitta's uncle Lord William and his cronies conspire to support young Henry in his plan to oust his father Henry II and rule England instead. Julitta also soon finds her hands full with a castle and mutinous servants allowed to run to ruin by the previous lord of Brentborough (Adam's uncle), a thieving seneschal, invading armies of Scots, a perilous climb down ocean cliffs, a mysterious death or two and more as \"Red\" Adam and his lady banter their way through it all to find true love in the end. While I very much enjoyed this book, at times it was a bit too busy and fast paced for my tastes. At times I lost track of who was who when characters from the first part of the book returned back to the story and the author didn't provide enough background to refresh my memory, and I got lost more than once until I fell back into the groove. A cast of characters and their various names and titles would have helped quite a bit and enhanced my appreciation of the story. That said, it was a highly enjoyable romp through the 12th century and a very entertaining read.

They are in getting ready to go to sleep and she tells him that if she ever calls him husband he will know that she is his. Which really matters at a later time. There are deer flapping at the oat cakes they were going to have to breakfast, and wild painted scots bent on murder. It's really a beautiful story.

When her path and that of the newly inherited lord of the district cross, fate steps in. Red Adam, drunk and mistaking Julitta for a peasant, abducts her to his castle, intent on ravishment. She barely fights him off, knocking him unconscious. So begins one of the best love stories I have ever read in my 40 years of avid readership. With forced marriage, uprising against the king, betrayal within the castle, and invasion by the unholy Scots, this novel has everything.

This is not your run-of-the-mill bodice rippers; this is actually a historically correct, realistic, and totally fascinating story. Ingram takes you right into the details and politics of what life was like for the real people, not the perfumed toadies in court. The times were perilous and things could (and did!) change in the blink of an eye. Julitta is one of the strongest fictional heroines I've read, and I love how the relationship between her and Red Adam develops. They're not perfect people, but they are honorable and they are perfect for each other. Even if Julitta doesn't believe it for quite a while -- maybe because she doesn't. This is not a hot, lustful romp; it's a love story set in a dangerous historical time, and it's really the best \"historical romance\" I've ever read.</td><td>This is a love story, not a romance</td><td>1346630400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2012-09-03</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>11254</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2WMEXIJ5Y9SU1</td><td>0002216973</td><td>Nina bellon</td><td>Not in the least liberated or politically correct.

The ravisher is none other than Red Adam, drunk as a skunk with his loutish friends and also on his way home.  Here you have two people who start out as enemies. Red Adam is everything she abhors in men: loud with the manners of a caveman and morals that are as low as a rock on the ground.  Mistaken, he thinks she is bashful until she bites him.  The description of these two going at it is so good you will think you are a fly on the wall in the room.  And then she knocks him out with a stool. Unable to leave the room because his friends want their turn with her, she waits until Adam wakes up.  And then they verbally go at it again, tit for tat. Until he tells her to bar the door after he leaves and he will marry her the next day. And so begins the unusual courting-after-marriage to earn Julitta's love.  Ever so slowly, he earns her respect.  Gritty and raw at times, RED ADAM'S LADY is one of those books where the less you know about the story the better. More adventure than romance, Ms. Ingram did a good job of setting up the scenes and giving the reader a good sense of both place and time.

As a rule, his books tend to be short and to the point, filled with action and marked with innovative ideas. Running Blind is one of my personal favorites (actually I think it is his best work) which I suddenly stumbled upon after many years. Allan Stewart, a retired intelligence agent is suddenly forced against his will to re-join the game just to complete one final assignment. Almost immediately, he finds himself in a maze of bluffs and double-bluffs. By a mix of good fortune and rusty skills, he escapes a trap and in doing so, stumbles almost by accident on the scary possibility that a top official in British intelligence may actually be a Russian mole (remember, this is a Cold War story). Of course, he now has to settle this question one way or the other. What follows is a terrific roller coaster of a story as Stewart (accompanied by his girlfriend), the mole, the Russians (including his opposite number thirsting for revenge after Stewart had long ago shot him in a very sensitive area!), and stray CIA agents engage in a fascinating pursuit over the Icelandic landscape, culminating in a shootout at the baddies hideout that is almost \"western\" in nature.

Book 4 was a lot of cut and paste from the previous three books with some updates on members of the younger generations.  Unexpected Blessings was less of a rehash and it followed the action from book 4 more smoothly.  I was happy to see that this story of Emma's great-granddaughters moved along without major inaccuracies from the first three books.  That being said, there are still gaps and minor errors.  For example, the relationship between Robin Ainsley and the rest of the Harte family continues from book four.  In book 4, this much improved relationship was not explained and remains unexplained in this book.  How Robin made it back into the graces of the family is a significant gap in the storyline between books 3 and 4.  This lack of explanation is more objectionable in book 4 because of the plot in that book, but it is still a mystery.  While it presumably relates to the secret revealed in book 4, the reader can only guess.  Those familiar with the first three books may find this is a very big disconnect.  One other mistake in this book is the recounting of the incident from the lives of Shane and Paula as children, wherein Shane paints Paula blue.  This incident actually occurred between Winston and Emily as is noted in book 2, \"Hold the Dream.\" I was taken aback by the vignette relating to the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  This incident should have been developed more fully or omitted completely.  Yes, the event showed in a limited way what some people went through.  However, given the considerable wealth of the Hartes, O'Neills and Kallinskis, and the financial companies located in the World Trade Center at that time, isn't it likely that they would have been more affected than they were?? Some of the good things in this book:  Tessa mellowing (after a harrowing experience) and acknowledging for the first time her true heritage; and the relationship between Edwina and several of Emma's great-granddaughers. I am looking forward to the continuing saga of the clans.</td><td>Another chapter</td><td>1105747200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-01-15</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>32998</td><td>4.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>ADGTWXUG0IM37</td><td>0002261367</td><td>M.

This book picks up in the summer of 2001, as Evan Hughes a newly discover relation of Emma Harte continues to get closer the Harte family as her own comes to England, while others members of the family are dealing with there own romantic relationship problems. I did enjoy this book more than \"Emma Secret\" but I can't understand why Ms. Bradford keeps doing the flashback chapters, its seems to pull away from the story.

I haven't and it was unbelievably boring.  How can a great grand mother who DIED OVER not 5, 10 or 15 but 30 YEARS AGO have so much influence on her family memebers. There is nothing that makes me care for the characters when all i read about is how much they are snobish and cliquey, and wealthy, privelged  and no outsiders allowed and Emma said this Emma said that. Its just not possible that family members down the line will mention emma's name evey single day of their lives. The book is also poorly written, so much exposition without any story. I througly hated this book. The writer should have ended with emma hartes story. The hartes are so elitist, i though i was reading about a secret society. Imagine ones daughter is kidnapped by her crazy father. What do you do? No, don't call the police because a long dead woman said no outsiders allowed. IT is much better if the father harms the child than having the GASP police(outsiders) involved. I am ranting now, but that book was a waste of time. I couldn't finish it.

Perhaps that's why we never get tired of reading of the adventures of Emma Harte and her descendants found in Barbara Taylor Bradford's novels. In UNEXPECTED BLESSINGS we find the great-granddaughters of Mrs. Harte struggling to find their way in a world that has changed considerably since that of their great-grandmother. From the bustling and busy streets of London to the quiet and beautiful moors of Yorkshire, however, age-old traditions, sense of history and family values are dominant. Evan Hughes, who arrived in England from America in EMMA'S SECRET, continues her work with Harte department stores and struggles with a secret that she would love to share with her father but fears might shatter his life as he knows it. Tessa Longden is engaged in a messy divorce and custody battle with a man who will stop at nothing to get his way. The only bright point is the new love she has discovered, but dare she hope it's one that will last? Linnet O'Neill is trying hard to forge a closer relationship with half-sister Tessa, but even business can come between the closest of sisters, much less two who have shared a lifelong rivalry. Last but not least, India Standish is involved in a breathtaking romance with a talented and dedicated artist who has secrets and prejudices that could come between them and wreck the best thing India has ever found. As if these day-to-day struggles are not enough, there are those who would wish the Harte descendants anything but good and will go to the greatest lengths to see them fall from their perch as one of England's strongest and most powerful families. Barbara Taylor Bradford continues to fulfill our need to know what happens to her descendants in UNEXPECTED BLESSINGS. She proves that she hasn't lost her touch and can still weave a fascinating story to follow the previous novels: A WOMAN OF SUBSTANCE, HOLD THE DREAM, TO BE THE BEST and EMMA'S SECRET. While dedicated fans are sure to be entranced by the new adventures of characters who feel like old friends, new readers also will find themselves drawn into the elite lifestyle and family ties that bind the Hartes and will most likely look to the previous books to see where it all began.   --- Reviewed by Amie Taylor</td><td>A fascinating addition to the saga of a Yorkshire family</td><td>1106352000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-01-22</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jan</td><td>127</td><td>127</td><td>4</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>33118</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A17ZN80S1AMC9H</td><td>0002261367</td><td>Christopher Robin</td><td>I did finish the book, so I guess it wasn't all that bad, but it didn't seem to have much purpose and it wasn't that entertaining or interesting.

This book had too many characters, storylines and insufficient detail. I had the feeling the writing was rushed, written too quickly to get it to press and not enough time was taken to give both the characters and storyline the depth that Emma's descendants deserve and that was originally created in the first book. I thought the twin tower replay was in poor taste and was both overdramatized and underutilized in the story line. This book was, in short, boring and disappointing. A pity, because so much more could have been done with this series, as I have found that each successive book is rather lackluster.</td><td>Banal, boring and undercooked</td><td>1130889600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-11-02</td><td>Wed </td><td>Nov</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>33113</td><td>2.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR</td><td>0002261367</td><td>Gabriela Perez</td><td>I remember liking the earlier book where I was first introduced to Evan, et. al., but this one left me utterly cold. The first problem I had with it was keeping track of all the relationships being developed in the book. This might not have seemed such a hardship if I had actually come to care about any of the people about whom I was reading, but I couldn't identify with any of them. I tried to like them, mostly because I like sagas that take several books to wrap up and are filled with interesting people I might like to actually know, and I wanted this to be one series I looked forward to reading more from. Alas, it wasn't to be. I found the language stilted. My American perspective perhaps makes it hard to enjoy dialogue filled with phrases like \"my darling\" and \"darling ,\" and I may be judging based on my own impatience with that, but it just drove me nuts. Do people in Britain actually speak that way so much? I really would like to know that. My feeling is that they don't, if other reading experiences with British authors are any indication. Also, I found the characters truly flat. Rarely did they behave \"out of the box\"; in other words, if they were part of the good guy circle, they were highly unlikely to act in any questionable way whatsoever. And the \"good guys\" were unassailably good; if a man got tossed into the mix, he had to be handsome, learned, famous, wealthy, and almost hypnotically appealing to a female character who herself seemed too good to be true. Strong women always win (by a lot).  Annoying/destructive men always lose. People fall in love in seconds flat with the person they immediately understand will unlock the mystery of their lives. Oy. Beautiful people living beautiful lives of wealth and privilege, and nary a person in the bunch who is anything like anyone I know. This may be what some readers are looking for, but I'm looking for reading material that provides some characters not like me and some whose motivations, feelings, and language I can at least fathom as being realistic within my frame of reference. I made it through the book, mostly because I kept hoping it would get better. Then, at the very end of the paperback version, the publshers had included a snippet of the author's next book in this series, and I read that just to see what it promised. It looks like one of the central tensions in that book will be related to whether the flagship store will (gasp) change. Doesn't that just make you want to read that book? I mean, what's more enthralling than a battle over whether to redecorate or revamp a store? Nope, that definitely did not grab me.</td><td>Disappointing, at least for this reader</td><td>1139356800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2006-02-08</td><td>Wed </td><td>Feb</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>476</td></tr><tr><td>33112</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A27M1MQV9KFS5S</td><td>0002261367</td><td>dancermommd</td><td>I am only half way through it and am struggling.

Kirkman</td><td>This book is a continuation of Emma's Secret, beginning with Robin and Evan, and the knowledge that he is Owen's biological father, which Owen will find out later in this book. And Evan is becoming really close to her newly found grandparent. Tessa is having many problems in divorcing Mark Longden, her abusive husband. Near the beginning of the book, he kidnaps Adele, their 6-year-old daughter, and Tessa is out of her mind with worry. They manage to track Mark down though, and later Paula, makes him settle for an offer he can't refuse to keep him out of her daughter's life. He has to follow her instructions right down to the letter, and is forced to agree unless he wants to go to prison. India and Dusty are in a relationship together, but India has no idea at all that Dusty is hiding a secret and doesn't trust her enough to tell her. His ex, Melinda whom he had a child with, sees him with Dusty at his home painting her portrait, (Dusty is a great very well-known artist), and stabs him. He almost doesn;t make it in time to the hospital, and would not have had it not been for India who drove him there in the nick of time. Later in the book, Evan who is seeing Gideon, and plans to marry him is pregnant. Her father is very upset with this whole relationship, though her mom is openly thrilled about it. Her dad just doesn't want her to become related to the Harte family for his own personal reasons. This comes to light also, later in the book. These were the main points of the story, and overall I enjoyed the book. It does go back in time to the 1950's when Emma was alive. There, it talks more of the family secrets.</td><td>About Love and Relationships-the Harte Saga Continues On...</td><td>1150070400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2006-06-12</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jun</td><td>33</td><td>33</td><td>12</td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>33106</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1N04AOP70MISN</td><td>0002261367</td><td>DragonsChest</td><td>Nice storyline, I enjoy keeping up with the family goings on.

The concerned family solicitor calls in the renowned private detective Hercule Poirot.  A piece of wedding cake, an oil painting copied from a post card, and a Victorian bouquet of wax flowers are among the clues that set Poirot on the trail of the killer.

Alec & Peggy Legge was who my mind settled on close to the end.

She accordingly puts through a call to old friend Hercule Poirot, who drops in on the proceedings to discover that some one has turned the game into reality. DEAD MAN'S FOLLY is not among Christie's better known works, and in truth it does not rank among her great classics.  Even so, it has its charms, particularly in the form of Ariadne Oliver, a somewhat frazzled, absent-minded, and eccentric character clearly intended as a parody of mystery novelists in general and Christie herself in particular.  The novel itself is nicely written and offers Christie's usual clever twist at the end.

This is all to the good because Dame Agatha is the master of the country house with endless servants hovering about doing tiny tasks.  Her one nod to modern times is a shortage of gardeners. Crime writer Ariadne Oliver calls upon her friend, Hercule Poirot.  She has been hired to provide a Mystery Hunt at Sir George Stubbs' annual Fete.  She has a \"hunch\" that all is not well.  Ms. Oliver is prescient; her mock \"victim\" turns into a real one.  There is no shortage of suspects, but Poirot and the authorities are baffled. Ms. Christie rains clues as big as rocks along with her usual red herrings.  The problem for the astute reader is not who (though Ms. Christie conceals the murderer with her usual adroitness), but how and why.  \"Dead Man's Folly\" is a very busy book, and the scattered presence of Ariadne Oliver (one of my least favorite continuing characters) is perhaps one distraction too many. Subtract one star for overdone motivation, and another one-half for Ms. Oliver's constant dithering.

As usual, Dame Agatha has her way with us, sending us off in the wrong direction, maddeningly obscure clues, and a thoroughly suspicious bunch of characters. Roger Abernethie's heirs are gathered to hear the will when flighty sister Cora drops the bombshell, \"He Was murdered, wasn't he?\" The next day Cora is found axed to death in her little cottage. We have a raft of suspects and Ms. Christie is careful not to give any of them a satisfactory alibi. \"After the Funeral\" is vintage Christie.  She was at the height of her powers (1953).  The characterizations were surprisingly deft (usually not her strong suit.) Uncle Timothy, the malingerer, was overdone, but George, the clever ne'er do well had some great malicious lines.  She has a marvelous sketch of a private detective, Mr. Goby who was \"--small and spare and shrunken.  He had always been refreshingly nondescript in appearance and he was now so nondescript as practically not to be there at all.  Mr. Goby was not looking at Mr. Poirot because Mr. Goby never looked at anybody----he emphasized his last point by nodding significantly at the sofa.\" This slyly humorous well done mystery was a pleasure to read.

The family lawyer calls in Poirot, who functions late, but very effectively.  Clueing top-notch standard job, including two brilliant devices (the mirror and the wax flowers) dangled lovingly (yet tantalisingly out of reach) before the reader's very nose.

However, at the reading, Cora Abernethie Lansquenet, the late Richard's youngest sister, who's always been something of an embarrassment to the family, brightly blurts out, \"It's been hushed up very nicely, hasn't it... But he was murdered, wasn't he?\" When Cora is found dead the next day, Hercule Poirot has the task of finding the killer. After the Funeral was written in 1953 and is an homage to Abney Hall (Enderby Hall in the book), the Victorian mansion where the young Agatha Christie spent a lot of her Christmas Holidays. The setting is typically Christie: a Victorian mansion, colorful characters, a butler, a murder and of course Hercule Poirot. The narrative keeps the reader hooked and slowly builds up to the climax. The conclusion is -like always- surprising, but also rather fair. With an eye for the little details you should be able to find the killer. You might have a problem with finding the motive, but that is a small price to pay.

Ariadne is busy organizing a murder hunt as part of a big charity event being held on the grounds at Nasse House. It seems that she is not completely in charge of the script of the murder, because people are constantly giving suggestions and hints on where and how to plan this fake murder. Ariadne truly fears that she is being used to hide a real crime that is about to take place and calls upon her old friend Hercule Poirot to sort things out. The famous detective finds all of this a load of silliness, but nevertheless starts to get a little curious. Dead Man's Folly is a typical Agatha Christie mystery. The setting feels familiar, the characters are most of the time trying to deal with their past and the crime is as mysterious and complex as you can get. A generation conflict between the old folks and the teenagers is added to spice things up. As an extra bonus the reader is treated on a denouement is far from realistic, but is fair enough seen the number of hints you get throughout the story. The only problem that stops the reader from finding it out for himself is the enormous number of red herrings. Noteworthy is that Nasse House is based upon Agatha Christie's favorite residence: Greenway house, the Devonshire home Christie occupied during most of her married life. The character of Ariadne is a caricature of Agatha Christie herself.

Mystery novelist (and Christie alter ego) Ariadne Oliver has been hired to devise a murder mystery game for a village fete.  While she is on the scene setting up the clues she begins to feel uneasy about the whole thing, as she explains to her friend, Hercule Poirot she fears that her pretend murder may be replaced by a real one! Alas, even with two sleuths a murder does occur during the party.  Poirot rises to the challenge and uncovers the culprit in the end of course.  Along the way he deals with the various classes of village society, as well as a youth hostel full of foreign students and even a visiting long lost cousin. As always with Christie the clues are all fairly laid out for the reader to find, hidden among all the red herrings.  Her characters are consistent, and the solution is clever.  We are also treated to a delightful opening scene with Miss Lemon as an added bonus. This is one of Christie's later works (1956) and while she did try to keep up with the changing times she didn't have the same feel for the post war world as she did for the '20's and 30's.  Even so one of Christie's lesser works is still better than most writers can ever hope to achieve.</td><td>Some people take games far too seriously....</td><td>1084060800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2004-05-09</td><td>Sun </td><td>May</td><td>41</td><td>38</td><td>12</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td>61888</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Gary F.

The scenario concerns Roger Abernathe, an elderly man of tremendous wealth whose death comes not a moment too soon to benefit family interests. Brother Timothy and sister Cora are in reduced circumstances.  Nieces Susan and Rosamund have made questionable marriages and are in dire need of money to keep their husbands in line.  And what nephew George has been up to is positively criminal.  All in all, it is a classic Christie set-up--and an instance in which she cleverly uses the readers' expectations against them in the most unexpected way imaginable. Christie is not usually noted for her clever characterizations, but she peoples her novel with a host of memorable characters ranging from the elegant Helen Abernathe to the peculiar Mr. Goby to the dithering Miss Gilchrist, and her turn with celebrated detective Hercule Poriot is among the finest she wrote.  Compulsively readable and with a head-spinning solution, AFTER THE FUNERAL easily ranks with Christie's great murder mystery masterpieces, a meticulously crafted novel in which she invites you into her parlor--and distracts you with tea and crumpets to prevent you from noticing her truly wicked way with a web.

Christie shrewdly paints a portrait of two cousins of very different sorts, Susan Banks, the charming, shrewd, business type, and Rosamund Shane, the sultry, ditzy actress, and we watch the two of them square off regarding their men and in battle for a green malachite table from their Uncle Richard's estate.  Both girls are convinced that the table should rightfully belong to them. I enjoyed hearing Hercule Poirot compare the events of AFTER THE FUNERAL to those of LORD EDGWARE DIES, a long ago case of Poirot's from the 30s.  That clue should have given readers with long memories good reason to suspect that the solution of this case had something to do with a dazzling impersonation. The strange behavior of Gregory Banks, the nutty pharmacist husband of Susan, the man who brags about how he was stricken people down with his prescriptions, make you think almost immediately that he is the killer. Everyone's a wee bit suspicious but with Greg, Agatha Christie really lays it on thick. The best scenes are those with Susan, who could have been the heroine of a Christie play (in 1953, when this novel was written, Christie was square in the center of her theatrical triumphs).  Both the scenes at Cora's house when Miss Gilchrist receieves the mysterious slice of wedding cake, and then later on at Enderby Hall when Susan and Rosamund fight over the malachite table, could have jumped right out from one of the best 50s plays. Weren't you surprised to hear that in 1953, if you had two thousand pounds, you could buy a Vermeer?  Now the figure must be infinitesimally larger.  Perhaps 20,000,000 pounds? No longer do we have to read this novel under its ersatz American title, which always reminded me of a title by A A Fair--\"Funerals Are Fatal.\" All in all, a nail biting thrill ride of terror and chicanery.</td><td>All In The Family</td><td>1097107200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-10-07</td><td>Thu </td><td>Oct</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>338</td></tr><tr><td>61886</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>A1N1YEMTI9DJ86</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Shirley Schwartz</td><td>This Poirot book is the usual fare for Christie fans.

From that simple beginning to the curious end, there are large number of characters with interesting stories of their own. The author has done an excellent job of creating the characters and in general bringing out the attitue of Englishmen towards foreigners. The story is interspersed with clues for the reader.

Christie delivers as she always has; the story is gripping, perplexing, witty, and charming. The premise is nothing new for Christie; most of her mysteries are domestic murders, where one of the household must have done it. This book follows the same pattern. What makes this story different and interesting is the Murder Hunt, organized by the character of Adriane Oliver. Since it will be obvious to the reader from the very beginning that Mrs Oliver is based on Christie herself, the whole Murder Hunt plays very effective mind tricks with him. It is as if the author has jumped into the mystery to give vital clues. The rest of the mystery is the typical blend of varied and fascinating characters, in a sprawling setting. The exotic foreigner, trophy wife, country squire, efficent secretary, all well-recognized mystery story hallmarks are present. Of particular interest is the character of Mrs Folliat, the old and mysterious ex-owner of the estate in which the story is set. As Hercule Poirot quickly divines, there's something about Mrs Folliat... The only problem with this book arises towards the end. With the exception of Oliver, Folliat and obviously the incomparable Poirot, the other characters are a shade disappointing. I have always appreciated Christie's shrewd analysis of the psyche of the domestic murderer. The reason why it is always near impossible to guess whodunnit is that the ruthlessness is always so neatly concealed within the character of the murderer. However, in this particular story, the characters are not as well-developed as they should be. They are interesting and plausible people, but rather simple. There is little of the shadowy bent of mind that makes them possible murderers. This leads to the actual solution sounding a tad contrived. A further disappointment is that the ending fails to tie up the Murder Hunt with the parallel tale of the actual murder. All along, the Murder Hunt has proven suggestible and exciting, but in the end nothing comes of it. Having said that, there is nothing seriously wrong with Dead Man's Folly. It possess all of Poirot's cunning and idiosyncratic charisma. And the true mark of the genius is that the reader will neither be able to guess at the solution before Christie herself decides to reveal it, nor will he be able to put the book down.</td><td>Mark of genius</td><td>1120780800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-08</td><td>Fri </td><td>Jul</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>17</td><td>408</td></tr><tr><td>61871</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2Y1SCM930PZI7</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Jabberwocky</td><td>This is easily the worst mystery I've read from Dame Agatha.

The plot revolves around the death of the wealthy Richard Abernethie, a death that no one though was particularly suspicious until Richard's somewhat dotty sister, Cora blurts out the question at the funeral, \"It was murder, wasn't it?\" This is a Poirot mystery and I remember when I read it the first time I was completely confident that I knew who the murdered was, only to find out at the end of the book that Christie had led me down the garden path by cleverly planting false clues, and I was completely wrong about who the murderer was. The best thing is, she had made those false clues so subtle, so unobvious, while at the same time planting other extremely obvious clothes toward yet another suspect. Here I had been patting myself on the back for not following the red herring and figuring out who the real killer, and instead I had fallen for a second, more subtle red herring. Several years later I read the book again, and I'll be darned if I didn't fall for the exact same trap the second time I read it. That is how much of a genius Agatha Christie was in developing her plot. She could lay false leads upon false leads and make it so subtle that the reader is convinced that s/he's out thought the author. So this is my favorite Christie book.

Incidentally, if the members of the Abernethy family hadn't been so self-conscious of their belonging to their social class, there wouldn't have been any mystery at all.

Her legendary Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot used his shrewd logic to defeat many criminals when microscopes and labs were used in other mysteries, taking the reader on a rid of their life as he tracked clues and interviewed the suspects. When Richard Abernethie dies and his family meets at the funeral, one person is certain that he was murdered. But when Cora, the one who knew something falls to the same fate as her brother, fingers start to point and everyone is in shambles unable to produce a clear alibi. Nieces and nephews, the servants and even strangers who were at the wrong place at the wrong time seem to hide something and it's not too soon when the famous Poirot, disguised as potential buyer of the Abernethie mansion is called to sort out the mess.  \"After the funeral\" was a complex and delightful read because it wasn't as simple as most books, this tale had so many guilty suspects that the hard part was weeding out the only one person responsible for the death while omitting more than a few red herrings and characters of mixed morals. Poirot outdoes himself relying heavily on his use of conversation, talking about nothing and everything to catch a phrase out of context and secure his bait. I adored the wide array of characters, the feuding family, snobby and marred with flaws as they made for a colorful read with one of the best twisted endings I have ever read. The story itself was simple yet it spiraled into a huge event, one that I loved sitting and reading for a few days, and always trying to find more time to devote to it.

First, as the title suggests, the story only begins after the funeral of a wealthy man.  When the relatives gather at the house afterwards, his sister blurts out that he must have been murdered even though he was known to be terminally ill and no foul play was suspected.  When that same sister is brutally murdered the very next day, however, there can be little doubt that something sinister is afoot and this is where Hercule Poirot is called upon.  Still, we don't see as much of him as we usually do.  The suspects are scattered about England and a number of the interrogations are conducted by other people and reported back to Poirot.  In the end, of course, Poirot gathers all the interested parties together and reveals the solution. Normally, I find that any Poirot novel suffers greatly when the Belgian is used sparingly.  So I was pleasantly surprised in this instance that the other characters were sufficiently interesting to carry the load.  The cast is pretty varied and I definitely found it interesting to see how they interacted with each other in the aftermath of these murders.  The story generally moves along at a good pace though it slowed down a touch toward the end.  The razor sharp humor that Poirot provides when portrayed at his best is largely absent here but the book doesn't suffer too badly. This is nowhere near the best Hercule Poirot novel but it certainly is a solid effort.

In this book, one \"murder\" is committed, then a second, then another person is poisoned and a fourth is \"coshed\" on the head.

Not only is the mystery intricate, with many clues and red herrings, her style of writing is mesmerizing -- extensive vocabulary, bits of philosophy, charming settings and social interactions, cozy and comfortable.

Unfortunately, she has a premonition that something awful is going to happen, and begs her friend Hercule Poirot to come to Nasse House at once. Although at first reluctant: Poirot does agree to come, and soon the pair are embroiled in a real-life mystery involving a possible kidnapping and multiple murder. The finale of this complicated little puzzle is well up to the Christie standard, but (like \"HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK\") the solution is too abruptly given and one or two key bits of information is kept secret from the reader until after Poirot has announced the killer's identity. And even though the scene of the novel is based upon Agatha's own fondness for Greenway House (the country estate she would later come to own): the various subplots feel tacked on, and the richness of the minor characters and suspects are sadly lacking in any charm or depth. As a result of the botched writing job: \"DEAD MAN'S FOLLY\" ends up on the list of \"so-so\" books within the Christie canon even though it had the potential to be a really good, first-class thriller. However, there is one striking feature that I must point out: the character of Mrs. Folliat (the former owner of Nasse House). She is without question one of Christie's finest creations, and a personality who seems to understand the truth behind the murders yet is hesitant to tell Poirot what all she knows.

I enjoyed it immensely. And for that, I high-handedly believed that it was just luck - a one-hit wonder, so to speak. (I find that keeping a healthy dose of pessimism is sometimes advisable so as to make my enjoyment of the same author's other work more rewarding.) And really, After the Funeral is a mystery that latches onto you a few paragraphs in from the first page. Latches on and refuses to let go. The sudden death of the head of the family, Richard Abernethie, has forced the rest of the brood to come together in the hopes of receiving good news of being left a huge chunk of the inheritance. It was only later after the reading of the will that one of the more cuckoo characters, Cora Lansquenet, makes a slip of the tongue and exclaims, \"But he was murdered, wasn't he?\" One more turn of events and then the story begins to unfold in an unhurried, but unmistakably steady pace. The arrival of the estimable Hercule Poirot certainly upped the stakes, making it clear to the reader that Christie has taken the gloves off. Now the hunt begins. The bevy of characters and their respective something-is-not-quite-right veneer keeps the reader on tenterhooks as to who might have done the deed. Snatches of well-placed hints about an object or an unrelenting memory from a past conversation all have the indubitable signature of this renowned crime-detective author. This is certainly a novel that proves the adage, You think you know...but you really have no idea... When Poirot was in the stage of giving his `speech' revealing who the culprit was, I still thought that I may have a handle as to who it could be...and so I was complacent. But the revelation was such that I literally had to straighten up. I was like, \"Eh, wha--? Huh?\" After that, I had not choice but to (again!) bow at this wicked talent of Christie.

Dead Man's Folly had all the makings of a fantastic Agatha Christie novel. Unfortunately, while the story was very well done, the mystery itself left much to be desired. I enjoy the mysteries that showcase Ariadne Oliver. I love the character, who seems very much to be a caricature of Agatha Christie herself. Her calling for Poirot to help her prevent a murder that hasn't happened yet set the stage for a wealth of possibilities. And Dead Man's Folly made great use of the investigative collaboration. The problem with Dead Man's Folly, and it's a huge one, was the ending. Agatha Christie usually gives us the clues, lets us figure out who we think is the murderer, and then shows us how naive we really are in the end. While there were clues in Dead Man's Folly, all were basically pointless. The killer, while being a complete surprise, came out of nowhere. No one could have figured it out, as it seemed to be a case of picking a random character at the last minute and creating evidence to make it all seem plausible. A wonderful premise, but a lackluster ending.</td><td>Reading with Tequila</td><td>1290297600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2010-11-21</td><td>Sun </td><td>Nov</td><td>39</td><td>39</td><td>36</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>61823</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>true</td><td>A1G37DFO8MQW0M</td><td>0006162754</td><td>C.

It is one of the best Agatha Christie novels I have read in which the famous Hercule Poirot the Belgian detective aids in the solving of a troubling family murder mystery.   The novel opens following the funeral of the wealthy Mr. Richard Abernethie. He is the owner and is the busy CEO of a family industrial firm. During the meal following the funeral obesquies the sister of Richard whose name is Cora Lasquenet blurts out that the dead man was murdered. Later the next day she herself is beaten to death with several blows of a heavy ax.   The suspects are fascinating characters: Helen Abernethie the widowed wife of Leo Abernethie who has been living abroad for many years prior to her visit to Enderby. Timothy and Maude Abernethie the brother and sister in law of Richard. He is in poor health being nursed by his stout wife who mothers him with care. Susan and Gregory Banks-Susan is the smart niece of Timothy. Gregory her husband is a chemist who has been in a mental rest home. Rosemary. and Michael Shane-Another niece of Richard Abernethie. She and her husband are in show business. Michael is unfaithful to his wife. Rosemary is a scatterbrained chatterbox who enjoys shopping. Mr. Entwhistle-The longtime family lawyer for the Abernethie family. He is a friend of Poirot and brings the little Belgian into the proceedings. He could have stepped out of the pages of Dickens! George Crossfield the ne'er do well nephew of Ricahrd Abernethie. He has huge gambling debts. Alexander Guthrie is an art critic. He was a friend of the late Cora Lansquenet. Miss Gilchrist is the companion of the late Cora. She once owned a tea shop but has become impoverished during the war.   The case includes strange nuns; poison wedding cake and arsenic poisoning. This reviewer was flumoxxed as to who the real murderer was; only Poirot and his genius can solve the crime.   This is a thinking person's murder mystery which is a fun read and a marvelous page turner. Match clues with Poirot and see if you can discover the foul murderer.

Only one aspect of _After the Funeral_ deserves high praise: the plot and denouement are clever -- so clever and memorable, in fact, that it's difficult to try and enjoy reading this book for a second time (as I tried), because apart from the clever plot, there is not much to enjoy here, unfortunately. And that is very much unlike in Agatha Christie's finest novels, which *are* re-readable because their only value isn't in the whodunnit. Ms. Christie must have been in a very gloomy mood when writing _After the Funeral_. In fact, the title says it all, about the novel's atmosphere. This is a post-World War II novel, and everyone seems dejected. There is an unpleasant air of plaintive nostalgia permeating the novel; incessant complaints (from *many* different characters) about how the world is deteriorating. In fact, you can't help feeling, while reading this novel, that it must have been written by an author who herself wasn't among the youngest. (Christie was 62.) And that is, of course, always a bad sign. Although the novel attempts to depict young characters, the prose isn't youthful at all, and the attempts at humour are rather strained. Agatha Christie's idealism seems to have vanished. In Christie's best books from the 30s and 40s, there were always at least a few characters depicted in a positive manner who helped retain the reader's interest. Here in _After the Funeral_, all the characters are disagreeable, unpleasant, and/or silly persons; the *only* person depicted more kindly than not, is Helen -- symptomatically, one of the oldest characters in the cast. Poirot is portrayed rather perfunctorily as well (only appearing for the first time 28% into the book); not much wisdom or many witty observations coming from him here. In short, _After the Funeral_ seems to me to indicate a decline in the quality of Christie's writing; it unpleasantly reminded me of such utter failures among Christie's late novels as _Third Girl_ and _Elephants Can Remember_; while those two are execrable and next to unreadable, _After the Funeral_ at least definitely is readable; it just seems to signal that the author is \"over the hill\" now, and that is always sad to realize.</td><td>Many Detestable Characters = Decreased Book Quality</td><td>1294272000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2011-01-06</td><td>Thu </td><td>Jan</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>38</td><td>380</td></tr><tr><td>61821</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AISUSPFYY68RO</td><td>0006162754</td><td>bookworm1858</td><td>After the Funeral by Agatha Christie Black Dog & Leventhal, 1953 303 pages Mystery; Poirot 4/5 stars Source: Library Summary: After the funeral of Richard Abernethie, his sister Cora posits the theory that he had been murdered, causing a ripple of shock throughout the gathered family.  The next day Cora is found, having definitely been murdered with a hatchet.  Presumably the same person did it but who can solve the mystery? Well the famous Hercule Poirot can! Thoughts: What a puzzler!  The final conclusion was so startling and I kind of wonder if it could have been solved.  I really feel like one of the major clues was based on intimate knowledge of the characters' looks and mannerisms which it is difficult to gain merely through reading.  I had high hopes that I could solve the mystery since there were only about six possibilities for the murderer, by my count, but of course I didn't because of that pretty big twist. There is not very much Poirot in the story.  Consequently I did not feel that he was very annoying.  He hardly spoke in his annoying French italicized words and he was often background as the Abernethie family spoke over him.  Indeed the bias of Britons against foreigners is seen in their reaction to the strange \"Frenchman\" (he is of course Belgian.) One especially interesting aspect was the historical context provided.  Despite the year (1953), it seems like wartime rationing was still not over [eggs] which is difficult for me to comprehend as that year is among America's brightest.  The lack of quality servants is also bemoaned; additionally one character's hopes of running a tea shop was ruined by the onset of war.  The tragedy of WWII kind of hangs over the entire story in a very interesting way. Overall: Average-not too much Poirot but the mystery was really interesting.

In my opinion, AFTER THE FUNERAL ranks in the top FIVE. In fact, after MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, it's my favorite. The villain/villains (?) (may be a man, may be a woman, may be both) is/are one of Christie's most delightful & original characters. The plot has everything Christie: Old mansion, quirky family heirs all looking suspiciously at one another, beautiful ladies & men who live way beyond their means & are desperate for their inheritance (deserved or otherwise), well-timed murders--and the REALLY quirky & fastidious Hercule Poirot. It is also filled with AC's very modern sense of humor. Yes, this one is DEFINITELY a keeper.

Although she was still easily capable of writing a fast-paced, well-plotted mystery, I would rank this book well below the best novels from her prime.  Poirot enters this book relatively late, but the mystery is satisfying and the clues are there to be seen -- by readers sharper than I am! The country house setting and mostly upper-class suspects fit the usual model of a Christie mystery.  But, unfortunately, the times leave their mark on this book.  During Christie's prime from the mid-1920s through the end of World War II, the British Empire was still intact and whatever hard times some people in England were suffering through, Christie's characters sailed through life in characteristically British style.  By the early 1950s, much in England had changed.  Gone, for the most part, are characters connected with the Empire -- none appears in this book -- and food shortages and high taxes have become an important topic of conversation.  In fact, the ravages of high taxes are mentioned so often in Christie's postwar books that it's pretty clear she must have personally felt their bite. So, at least for me, while the mystery itself is fine, the atmosphere is significantly different from what you find in the classic Christie mysteries of earlier years.  If, like me, you have already read most Christie mysteries, you will find this one to be quite enjoyable.  If, on the other hand, you are new to Christie, a better place to start would be \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\" or \"The A.B.C. Murders.\"  You should note that this book was also published under the title \"Funerals Are Fatal\" -- I made the mistake a few years ago of buying a Christie that I already owned under another title.

When I'm in the mood for a mystery novel, I find that I can never go wrong by choosing an Agatha Christie, and Hercule Poirot is generally my detective of choice (though I have enjoyed some Miss Marple mysteries, too). It is rare that I can ever guess who the culprit is, though I came oh-so-close this time, changing my mind towards the end thanks to Christie trying to throw us off the scent. Christie's key clues to solving her mysteries are almost always so subtle that I tend to miss most of them. Naturally, Poirot doesn't miss even the tiniest detail before stunning the gathered \"suspects\" with his (in this story) unsuspected brilliance. Not only can she map out a great \"whodunnit?\" story, but Christie also throws in quite a bit of humor in the process, which makes for a fun read. Sure, the victim was bludgeoned with a hatchet -- rather gory stuff -- but you can't help but laugh out loud at the quirky characters in the story, most especially the victim herself. I was rather sorry that she didn't get to stick around the entire time, I can only imagine what else she would have said (in addition to the teaser I posted on Tuesday). You can always count on Poirot to be an amusing character, a bit foppish, arrogant (but rightfully so), and seemingly dimwitted when he wants to go unnoticed. Overall, I very much enjoyed After The Funeral. It didn't blow me away like some of Christie's other mysteries, but it is a solid story that provided much entertainment.

The riddle is solved.\" And he did it not knowing anything more than you do as a reader. That's what makes Agatha Christie so interesting, I think. Her mysteries are sometimes awfully challenging to solve, but they are possible to solve.  You don't need any scientific, medical or any particular specialized knowledge to be able to point an accusing finger at some character and be fairly confident that your suppositions will be borne out by Monsieur Poirot (or by Miss Marple) in the end. At one point in this book Poirot mentions something that someone said, but shouldn't have said. \"That was stupid of her, wasn't it?\" asked Rosamond Shane, a niece to one of the deceased characters herein. Poirot shook a forefinger at her. \"It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversation. It is a profound belief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject whatever, sooner or later they will give themselves away.\" And in this book it was something one person said which could not possibly be true and once you realize that, that this person is the murderer, the explanation of the crime falls rather easily into place.  Of course, if you miss this one sentence then you will find yourself in big trouble as to who did what to whom.  Of course Poirot, unlike readers such as myself sometimes, never misses anything. Thus, near the end of this book Poirot has wrapped up everything very nicely: \"Let me, first, go over the various points which were brought to my attention by the excellent Mr. Entwhistle. First, Mr. Richard Abernethie dies suddenly. Secondly, after his funeral, his sister Cora Lansquenet says, \"He was murdered, wasn't he?\" Thirdly Mrs. Lansquenet is killed. The question is, are those three things part of a sequence? All I can tell you, the prospective reader, is yes and no, and suggest that you read this enjoyable Agatha Christie book yourself!

While Poirot knows whodunit for some pages before the reveal, I also figured out whodunit at the same time he did. It helped that I had a day to think all the clues over. I was tickled that I got the whole sequence right, including motives. I love it when the clues are all there, but the answer isn't immediately obvious. We didn't get to know any of the characters very well, but they were interesting and had varied personalities. The details about the setting and time period were minimal but interesting. There was a very minor amount of bad language. There was no sex or gore.

But one does not know what to look for. And so one looks in the wrong places or for the wrong things.  So intones, Hercule Poirot in Agatha Christie's mystery Dead Man's Folly. Merriam-Webster Dictionaries  defines a folly as \"a very unusual or fancy building that was built in a garden for decoration or amusement in the past\"  and one of these plays a central part in this mystery. Another definition would  be \"a foolish act or idea.\"  Example herein, as illustrated by the character Alec Legge: \"Do you know what I should like to see done in this country?\" \"I should like to see every feeble-minded person put out---right out! Don't let them breed. If, for one generation, only the intelligent were allowed to breed, think what the result would be!\" \"A very large increase of patients in the psychiatric wards, perhaps,\" said Poirot drily. \"One needs roots as well as flowers on a plant, Mr. Legge.  However large and beautiful the flowers, if the earthy roots are destroyed there will be no more flowers.\" Asides such as this (notwithstanding it being a clue too) make Agatha Christie interesting to read and I am glad she has so many works worth reading (including this one).  In this book a mystery writer plays host for a staged fake murder mystery hunt on the grounds of a posh estate. The character, Ariadne Oliver, is most unlike Agatha Christie herself, thankfully, and comes across as a personality who writes popular mysteries and is more interesting than the books she has written; almost the opposite of Miss Christie, herself.  Hence this line herein, from Mrs. Oliver to Christie's Poirot: \"I can't imagine why everybody is always so keen for authors to talk about writing. I should have thought it was an author's business to write, not talk.\"</td><td>Poirot on others: \"[O]ne does not know what to look for.

I did identify which bits of information were important and I had some ideas about what each clue could mean, but none of my guesses were exactly right. Still, it's possible someone could guess it.

Soon the character who utters this pronouncement is herself murdered, and (to borrow the phrase) the game's afoot! This Poirot novel pits the Belgian sleuth against a puzzle of one mysterious death after another, and no shortage of suspects, all potential murderers. Readers are given a glimpse into the detectives thoughts as he pries into the case with his accustomed tricks. The delight of revisiting our old friend is matched only by the feel of the time period: set in the aftermath of WWII, the feel of an England still recovering is prevalent and palpable. Christie always knows how to set a scene, create unique and realistic characters, and this is no exception. The book is also a meditation on the fact that any of the characters harbors within them the potential to murder. This serves to imbue the most casual details with menace since the reader will not know where it make lead.</td><td>Christie gets the best of me once again!</td><td>1398556800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-04-27</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>75</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>61729</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A34HYLJOZHVHR3</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Dottie Serio</td><td>I love the Hercule Poirot series and this one did not disappoint.

Callahan</td><td>This is one of Agatha Christie's larger and more complex efforts.  The array of suspects includes at least eight or ten characters.  The murders are linked to a large inheritance.  Many of Christie's suspects are very disgusting or insipid.  These include the hypochondriac Timothy with his continual whining about his health; George who pretends to be an investor, but is really just a compulsive gambler;  and Michael, who pretends to be a good husband, but is really a serial philanderer.  Seldom in Christie do we encounter so many unpleasant characters, or such a tangled web of clues and suspicions. We suspect that many of the heirs will go through their large inheritance very rapidly.  Michael and Rosamond will finance very bad plays, pursuing their egotistical dream of becoming theatrical greats.  George is already in deep debt to casinos, and will fritter away the rest of his inheritance at the dice table. Hercule Poirot explains that in this case physical evidence is not to be found, so he must approach the mystery by analysis of those characters who had opportunity and motive.  The characters come to life through dialog -- pages and pages of it.  The novel involves a series of set scenes with all the suspects given free rein to ramble on and on.  Poirot says that, given enough aimless conversation, the killer will unwittingly reveal himself.  So it proves in this case. Ms. Christie is a master of settings.  We have the manor house, which figures several times.  There's a lawyer's office where several scenes take place, a few posh London apartments, and a rustic little cottage in a small village. The novel was great fun.  Agatha again contrasts the dignified and \"classy\" world of the old money and aristocracy against the grifters and opportunists that appear to be taking over English society.  A case of the fine old gentry being displaced by very shallow, venal descendents.  Such is the tension in a number of her novels.  The old butler is a kind of choral character.  He has seen the old and the new, the best and the worst -- the old world in collision with the new.  That old butler is a fine \"foil\" expressing Agatha's own point of view. I liked it.  Buy it.

There are a lot of people involved in the planning of this fete (which is basically a village carnival), so there are many things going on all at the same time and a variety of relationships making themselves known between people, as Poirot makes his observations. The story has a bit of a house party feel, with all the people and visitors to the house.

I had read this book many years ago and had completely forgotten the culprit and the idiosyncrasies of Hercule Poirot.  Hercule makes use of his little gray cells to solve the mystery in classic Christie fashion albeit too late to prevent a few murders. Hercule Poirot is summoned by his friend, mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, to put at ease her discomforting feeling that somehow she was being manipulated in the planning of her murder hunt for a wealthy country squire.  The mystery hunt was to be a combination treasure hunt/scavenger hunt with the winner finding clues and eventually solving the murder and winning a prize.  However, after the contest has barely begun, an actual murder identical to the fictional murder takes place.  Hercule has only been on the scene a short time, but immediately sets to work to try to find the killer.  To complicate things, on the same day as the murder, the country squires wife goes missing.  Now, Hercule has two mysteries to solve.  After a couple of days, Hercule must return home without success. A couple of months later Hercule is still puzzled by these two mysterious events and his lack of success.  He returns to the country squires home in an attempt to ferret out more information.  He realizes he has been led astray very cleverly by the killer and now begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together.  He soon solves the mystery in his mind, but lacks proof.  He contacts the local authorities and they begin searching for evidence of foul play, which they find. This story reminded me of the genius of Agatha Christie with her use of subtle hints that can be easily missed if the reader isn't paying attention.  The expert use of the red herring to mislead readers is also evident in this work.  There is some swearing and a derogatory term used in the story just to let readers know.  I based my rating on the ability of the author to tell a good mystery.</td><td>Dead Man's Folly</td><td>1407110400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-08-04</td><td>Mon </td><td>Aug</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>87</td><td>362</td></tr><tr><td>61709</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1R79E39JS3WEQ</td><td>0006162754</td><td>flriley</td><td>I enjoyed reading Dead Man's Folly again.</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>1407196800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-08-05</td><td>Tue </td><td>Aug</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>88</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>61697</td><td>3.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A1UEGBAHUQSSCE</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Khirul</td><td>While generally engaging and satisfying, this is one of the works in which Christie's strong plotting is marred by her occasional tendency to make things needlessly complicated, as well as by her excessive tolerance for greed in the upper class.

Since I loved her very revealing autobiography, I'm fascinated by her spoof of herself in the character of mystery writer Ariadne Oliver.  The introduction of the daffy-but-shrewd Mrs. Oliver not only gave Christie a chance to poke fun at her own eccentricities (real and rumored) but also to make life hell for her brilliant, irritating detective - the egomaniacal Hercule Poirot. As for the plot, well it's a mystery, isn't it?  Somebody gets murdered and the detective has to figure out who-dun-it and the other characters have to throw in as many monkey wrenches as they can to make sure that the crime isn't solved until the end of the book. Although I think Christie's stories were well and intelligently plotted, I read them for their charm and their realistic characters. Of course, you can argue that the bluff, good-natured country squire and the self-absorbed beauty and the acidulous spinster and the grand lady of the manor are stereotypes, but don't be surprised if old Agatha pulls the rug out from under you.  Some of these folks are NOT what they seem! My only criticism is that (in my opinion) one of the main characters would NOT have gone along with the charade, but the author would counter that she HAS to or there will be no book.  Irrefutable logic.  I'm also intrigued by  Miss Brewis - the hyper-efficient secretary who's in love with her boss and has a very poor opinion of his lovely, scatty wife.  After the author's death, her widower married his long-time, devoted  secretary. Coincidence or Dame Agatha getting in a sly dig at her husband?

An unusual call from Miss Ariadne Oliver the crime novelist who bears a distinct resemblance to her creator Dame Agatha Christie (1890-1976), Ariadne asks Poirot to leave his luxurious London digs. Poirot arrives at Nasse House. The estate of sixty-five acres in owned by Sir George Stubbs. Stubbs is oafish but wealthy. He is married to the fetching but stupid Lady Hatite Stubs. Oliver wants Poirot  to judge the winner of a contest to determine the fake murderer in a murder hunt game. A young girl Marilyn Tucker is acting as if she has been strangled to death in a boathouse near the lake. What occurs is that Marilyn is actually murdered! Meanwhile, Lady Stubbs disappeared. Later still an old man who works at the ferry is found dead. It later turns out that he too was murdered.   The book is well written and it is easy to sort out the suspects. The least likely person in the novel turns out to be the real murderer with an associate also involved in a murder   The book was first published in 1956. It was filmed in 1986 with Peter Ustinov playing Poirot and Jean Stapleton doing a turn as Ariadne Oliver. A recent Masterpiece Mystery production starred David Suchet.  This would be a good book for someone new to the works of Agatha Christie to get their feet wet. Be warned, though, that once you become a fan of Dame Agatha you will stick with her through many wonderful novels.

You probably puzzled it all out within the first fifteen minutes, while I had to wait until the very end of Dead Man's Folly to discover who was the real killer. Once again Agatha Christie takes her audience on a roller coaster ride of red herrings, peculiar characters, and mysterious clues. Ariadne Oliver, who is one of my favorite recurring characters, has been asked to write a game that resembles a murder mystery party. Oliver feels as if she's being played or steered when the players start suggesting changes to her story.  So she does the only practical thing she can do--she calls Poirot. While her game is being played, two things happen: 1. A murder. 2. The disappearance of Lady Hattie Stubbs. And of course, Poirot is on the case! This is an intriguing story with a few plot twists that kept me guessing. I really had no idea who the murder was, or what the motive was until Christie laid it all out at the end. I tried to use my 'detective skills' from watching Poirot and Marple on the small screen. But alas, nothing. I love the way Christie writes such diverse characters. All of them with a plausible motive. I can't compare this to other Hercule Poirot books that Christie has written. as this is my first, but I would like to say: Well done, Christie! There's a reason why Christie is known as the Queen of Mystery, and this book is a clear example as to why.</td><td>Fantastic!</td><td>1409529600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-01</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>102</td><td>298</td></tr><tr><td>61669</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A2IEEN02KO9ISO</td><td>0006162754</td><td>lighthouse88</td><td>An older gentleman dies suddenly, leaving his fortune to be divided amongst his relatives.  After his funeral, his family is gathered together when his sister blurts out that she thinks her brother was murdered.  No one takes her seriously it seems until she is murdered the very next day.  The lawyer in charge of the brothers estate begins to investigate on his own, but soon realizes he is out of his element.  He contacts his old friend, Hercule Poirot, to help discover if, in fact, his client was murdered and who murdered his sister. He inserts himself into the family and has trouble eliminating any of the other family members as suspects.  It appears no one has a verifiable alibi.  As Poirot continues to question the family, he begins to make the killer more nervous, making a mistake that allows Poirot to narrow the field.  The family dynamics and the different characters make the plot interesting with plenty of red herrings to keep readers guessing. This story was just a great whodunit!  I had read the story many years ago and when I read it again, I enjoyed it just as much the second time.  I didn't figure out the murderer the first time or the second time, but was completely involved in the story and was sorry to see it end.  The characters are quintessentially British and Hercule Poirot is at his finest.  The plot is interesting and will keep readers tuned in from beginning to end.  This is one Agatha Christie mystery readers will not want to miss.  I hope in the future to re-read other of these wonderful classic mysteries and post my reviews here.</td><td>After the Wilderness</td><td>1409529600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-01</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>103</td><td>291</td></tr><tr><td>61670</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>AKYZ3ZGKG5K9D</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Funny</td><td>There is absolutely no one like Agatha  Christie!!!

Mr. Abernethie ran a successful family business and with the death of only son occurring years earlier, the heirs to the family money include Richard's hypochondriac brother Timothy, his sister Cora, whom no one has seen in twenty years after she married a man considered 'unsuitable', nieces Susan, a businesswoman, Rosamund, an actress, and nephew George, in finance. At the home after the funeral, Cora carelessly tosses off a comment about Richard being murdered. Most of the family chalked it up to Cora just stirring up the pot, as she is won't to do. But the next day, Cora is brutally murdered in her home, and now Mr. Entwhistle is concerned that perhaps Richard was murdered. He goes to Hercule Poirot to investigate and find out if Richard was murdered and who killed Cora. I found it amusing when Poirot turns to Mr. Goby, a man \"famous for the acquiring of information.\" Goby calls government snooping \"God's gift to investigators.\" Given what we know about the NSA, one could infer that government's spying on their citizens is a time- honored practice. The family members all have money issues: Timothy hasn't worked due to his \"illnesses\", and his house and car are falling apart. Susan wishes to buy a pharmacy for her husband. Rosamund wants to use the money to support her and her husband's dreams of staging a play. George apparently has a gambling problem and has been using clients' funds to cover his losses. They all have motives for wanting the money, and Poirot discovers that many of them had opportunity as well. It's great fun following the clues and trying to put the puzzle pieces together to discover the murderer. (I confess that I was wrong.) It's interesting that Poirot does not dominate the story. He comes into the story late and stays in the background for the most part. In today's mystery/thriller series books, the protagonist (a cop, investigator, medical examiner) tends to dominate the stories of the books, with the crime relegated to equal or lesser plotlines. I also found it interesting the lengths that people will go to when money is involved. Like government spying, greed appears to be something that has been with humans for a long time, and probably will be for a long time to come. Now that I have read three Agatha Christie novels, two of them featuring M. Poirot, I'm curious to read Sophie Hannah's take on the iconic character in The Monogram Murders.</td><td>A standout Agatha Christie novel</td><td>1410134400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-08</td><td>Mon </td><td>Sep</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>105</td><td>436</td></tr><tr><td>61644</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1UTEVCX14LK2B</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Book Ensz</td><td>Another engaging masterpiece.</td><td>Great read</td><td>1410393600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-11</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>106</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>61643</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>A39529JJJEEDP5</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Whistlers Mom</td><td>I'm a confirmed Miss Marple fan  myself, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy watching Hercule Poirot pull a rabbit out of a hat.  Although no spring chicken, he does a fine job here, especially considering that he isn't even called into the case until Chapter 7. The back story is a bit complicated, involving the large family of a prosperous Victorian manufacturer.  The Man-Who-Made-The-Money is long since gone and so are most of his children.  Then the remaining ones start dying off - some suspiciously, some violently.  Looks like one of the younger generation may be clearing the deck for a large inheritance.  But which one?  The stuffy old family lawyer tries some detective work on his own, with predictable results.  Finally (in Chapter 7) he calls in the heavy artillery - his old friend the semi-retired M. Poirot. Poirot in turn calls on HIS semi-retired buddy - the wonderful Mr. Goby.  Mr. Goby's business is to collect information and there's not much he can't find out.  He has a great deal to say about the younger generation and the advantages and disadvantages of Big Brother governments.  He speaks exclusively to various pieces of furniture and is one of my favorite Christie characters. The setting is post-WWII England and the older folks are grumbling about high taxes and labor unions and the lack of proper servants.  The younger folks are choosing mates and pursuing careers and trying to get what they can out of their older relatives, while avoiding them like the plague.  I especially enjoyed the two female cousins - two young women who seem as unlike as night and day and yet who have very similar attitudes toward their men. Poirot carefully, tirelessly shifts through the alibis and the motives and listens to all the people involved because he knows that eventually we ALL reveal ourselves in our conversation. In the end, it boils down to one thing.  If no one is watching you, you can get away with murder.</td><td>The advantage of being invisible</td><td>1410393600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2014-09-11</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>107</td><td>347</td></tr><tr><td>61642</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A1N0TSO5L4IF9G</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>A very good book.

After the Funeral takes place as the title suggests: after the funeral. When Cora attends her brother's funeral, at the reception she casually mentions he might have been murdered. Though many of her family members write her off as a nutter, the family solicitor can't help but make his own inquiries. Then the unthinkable happens--Cora is murdered! There's nothing left to do except seek the help of the great Hercule Poirot. This is one of those mystery novels where the entire cast of characters has many motives to commit the crime, but you have absolutely no idea who the killer could be. So it wasn't till the end when Poirot lays out evidence that it all comes together.

That's probably why I can read it so fast. When I was 12, my mother tried to get me in the habit of reading a book before I went to bed. I'm not sure why. I've been a bookworm since I could read, so I certainly didn't need any encouragement. I enjoyed TV mysteries and Nancy Drew, so someone - I don't know who - suggested Agatha Christie. I got three omnibus volumes of Christie - one Poirot, one Miss Marple, and one mixed (including the dreadful Tommy and Tuppence - yuck!). In the Poirot volume was \"Dead Man's Folly.\" I have loved it ever since. Hercule Poirot receives a phone call from his friend, Ariadne Oliver, a mystery novelist. Something is up, but she can't or won't explain. He just has to come down to Nasse House in Nassecombe. Worried that something serious is wrong, Poirot heads for Nassecombe, a picturesque English village. Nasse House was formerly home of the Foliots, but the family has died out and the house is now the property of the nouveau riche Sir George Stubbs and his apparently dim-witted, though beautiful, wife, Hattie. There is to be a fete (a type of festival or fair) and Mrs Oliver is in charge of planning the Murder Hunt - which is the problem. Mrs Oliver has the sense that someone is manipulating her somehow, though she is not sure who exactly is responsible. Poirot trusts Mrs Oliver's intuition. And I know what you always say or look about intuition. [Mrs Oliver] One calls things by different names, said Poirot. I am quite ready to believe that you have noticed something, or heard something, that has definitely aroused in you anxiety. I think it is possible that you yourself may not even know just what it is that you have seen or noticed or heard. You are aware only of the result. If I may so put it, you do not know what it is that you know. You may label that intuition if you like. Poirot stays on, ostensibly to hand out prizes, but in actuality to do some detecting. How can he detect a crime that hasn't been committed? While the everything appears to be going well and people are enjoying themselves, there is a murder - of the girl playing the victim in the Murder Hunt. Her death is not the first and it will not be the last. I love it when Christie sets her mysteries in English villages. She does a lovely job of bringing the world to life, even while it was actually dying out. Another good portrayal of this is in \"The Body in the Library,\" where murder strikes close to Miss Marple's home. If you've never read a Christie, this is a good one to start with. It's fun, easy to read, and makes you want to reread it so you can see what you missed the first time through. That's unusual - I've read quite a few mysteries where I had no intention of ever rereading them. This is not one of those. Highly recommended.</td><td>One of my favorite Christies</td><td>1413244800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-10-14</td><td>Tue </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>126</td><td>524</td></tr><tr><td>61594</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A2U8WSU5VSMYHC</td><td>0006162754</td><td>Ms. Yow</td><td>Classic Agatha Christie!

The book is hardback, approximately A4 size and runs to 46 pages. The illustrator, Marek, has interpreted Christie's slightly caricatured cast of characters well and has also brought out some of the humour and lightness of tone that always makes her books a joy. Dead Man's Folly features Poirot and his novelist friend Ariadne Oliver investigating the death of a young girl murdered during a village fte. The plot is easy to follow in this format, though as to be expected much of the investigation is very abridged. This may act as a good introduction for older children to Christie's works, and I'm sure would also be an interesting curiosity for established fans.

Bledsoe</td><td>I was in the proper mood for an Agatha Christie mystery when I sat down to read \"Dead Man's Folly.\" I was thrilled to note how skillfully she used dialog to rapidly sketch out characters. During the opening pages she clearly invents the concept of the murder-mystery party, which has been a popular entertainment for some decades since. All good. Poirot is swept aside as the police investigate the murder of a young girl. As this investigation continues to plot and feel to the story flattens. Pages turn and that sense of why I read Agatha Christie melts away. Yet I am patient as I read. At last Poirot re-enters the story. He is puzzled too, which is good because I wouldnt want to it be too easy. At last the solution dawns on Poirot. In the final scene Poirot confronts not the culprits, but oddly enough one of the peripheral characters and lays out the truth. But the truth as he reveals the details could not possibly have been the result of the workings of the little grey cells. The resolution as it stands must have come from routine investigation and not of inspiration. When Poirot would have had time to do this investigation is the greater mystery. Somehow he just knows these things. As I read I turn the page and Voila! I am faced with a blank page and must conclude that the last words written were the last words of the story. Most unsatisfactory. Clearly this solution is not the result of Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation would not have been the most entertaining, but the solution provided strains believability.

If the prosecutors could simply point out that Gary Murphy knowlingly disguised himself on a daily basis to be \"Mr. Chips,\" then they could have shown that Soneji was not a schizophrenic.  Being a \"nice\" schoolteacher took enormous effort on the part of either Murphy or Soneji - thus, pre-meditation for crime was apparent at this stage.  Teachers at Washington Day describe \"Murphy\" as likable - it couldn't have been \"Murphy,\" ever, teaching school.  Murphy would have wondered what the hell he was doing in a classroom, in DC, in a wig.  He never did.  Therefore, the whole ploy was impossible from the get-go.  Luckily, Patterson was able to distract us with burning crosses and other sub-themes so that we readers would gloss over the weakness of any schizophrenia defense.  At least we can take comfort in the wise decision of the jury; for they saw through the weak defense argument.</td><td>There seems to be some enormous holes in the plot.</td><td>898560000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>1998-06-23</td><td>Tue </td><td>Jun</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>184</td></tr><tr><td>73842</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A109B0SCCCM7BM</td><td>0006476155</td><td>tsimpson@energyintel.com</td><td>I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end!

A brilliant African American detective with a higher moral agenda than your average suspense novel protagonist.  In Along Came a Spider we  are introduced to Patterson's seamless blending of first and third person  narrative that works so well with a many faceted character such as Alex  Cross.  This book succeeds on many levels: as the villian Gary Soneji is  trully vile but not unbelievably so, the supporting characters such as  Alex's family are made interesting and revelant to the story, and it  progresses quickly with twists and turns that lead to a surprisingly  emotional ending. Along Came a Spider has a little of everything: criminal  psychology, courtroom drama, love, murder, kidnapping, insightful family  interaction, and the kitchen sink!

I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross.  (I hate to read a series out of order, even if the stories are independent and  don't continue from book to book.)  Along Came A Spider is a perfect  \"fun\" read.  It moves at a very rapid pace.  (The chapters are  usually just a few pages.)  It has pretty well developed characters  considering its quick pace and more plot twists than you'll ever  anticipate.  Just when the romance element in the book started to bore me  Patterson turns it on its ear.  Another thing that makes this book so good  is that despite the surprising plot twists everything is fairly believable  within the context of the story.  I read a lot of mystery/suspense and one  of my biggest complaints is that I'll get really into a book and the climax  will be totally ridiculous.  You know, the killer will turn out to be the  sister of the girl that was accidentally drown in the rich family's pool  the night of the prom thirty-five years before but nobody recognizes her  because she's a master of disguise or whatever!

I will just say that  this novel was like reading two different novels.  One was a very  intelligent suspenseful mystery about a kidnapping carried out to go right  where the Lindbergh kidnapping went wrong.  The scenes of Alex Cross trying  to find Gary Soneji, the court scenes, and the conversations between Cross  and Gary Murphy are wonderful. This part of the novel gets 5 stars. However,I subtract two stars for the unbelievably boring and uninspired  romantic twist to the story, there was a point where I just decided to skip  whole chapters that didn't add anything to the story.  I got through the  first three hundred pages faster than I did the last two hundred.  It was  just mesmerizing to think that the same brilliant mind that came up with  the suspenseful mystery came up with the other garbage.  Don't get me wrong  I do enjoy romance in a mystery novel, in fact I think its an important  part but Patterson should ask Jeffery Deaver, who writes so well about the  relationship between Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, or maybe ask Ridley  Pearson, who does so well with Lou Boldt and Daphne Mathews, to give him a  few tips on mixing romance with suspense. My reccommendation is read this  novel but if the mood starts getting romantic don't waste your time, at  least not until the end where the romantic scene is important. Alex Cross is  a great character and Gary Soneji is the perfect nemesis, I just feel that  Patterson did a better job of mixing his romantic chapters with the story  in Cat and Mouse than what he was able to accomplish in this novel.</td><td>Good  suspense, but unbelievably boring romantic scenes!</td><td>966470400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2000-08-17</td><td>Thu </td><td>Aug</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>15</td><td>343</td></tr><tr><td>73813</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3Q330VXNDI9K3</td><td>0006476155</td><td>michael luciano</td><td>Do yourself a favor and read this book.

Almost jumping off the pages and into your nightmares is what James Patterson manages to succeed in doing to you.  Here is fair warning: IF you have a penchant for dreaming about the books you read, you may want to avoid Patterson's books at all costs!  His characters are SO BAD they almost defy the words in the English language to fully describe. Gary Soneji is also one thing many serial killers are not: He is VERY smart (maybe not smart enough NOT to kill, but pretty darned intelligent) but he is also hopelessly past all ability to rehabilitate, too.  Patterson's pace is so fast that there is practically a new chapter on every-other-page.  The pacing is like a semi coming down a steep grade with no brakes.  Watch OUT!

McGuire</td><td>Having read everything by Michael Conelly and Jeffrey Deaver, I was looking for a master of suspense with an imaginative and intellectual lead character. I found both with James Patterson's Along Came A Spider and Dr. Alex Cross. Alex Cross is a lead detective with the Washington Police Department. He is also a very able licensed psychologist. While investigating a series of murders he is called out to take the lead in the investigation of the kidnapping of a politician's son and a movie star's daughter (Maggie Rose).  It isn't long before he finds out the murderer and the kidnapper are one in the same. The manhunt for Gary Sonjei and the search for little lost Maggie Rose have Cross teamed up with the FBI and the Secret Service. Sonjei proves to be evil incarnate with a master plan and a high I.Q.  The plot thickens and surprises abound, keeping interest at a high level throughout the book. Patterson delivers what every suspense reader wants.... a vulnerable and loveable good guy along with a bad guy that has you afraid to turn out the lights at night.

I didn't have to worry about a slow or annoying plot in Along Came A Spider because it moved very quickly.  Patterson did a great job of moving the characters right inot the feel of the novel.  The characters were superb.  There were many instances in which I felt like I was Detective Cross and my decisions would determine the outcome of sticky situations.  Along Came a Spider was able to grab my attention and hold it.  After the first couple of pages, I soon found myself unable to put the novel down at time that I knew I should have.  Along Came A Spider truly impressed me to the fact that I can not wait to finish reading Patterson's next thriller, Kiss the Girls.

I have read all of them three or four times each by now..they really are that addictive.  Alex Cross, the fictional love-of-my-life, is a tough, detective/psychologist in the Southeast side of Washington D.C.  Alex has a wonderful family and best friend Sampson (who I always imagine as a Forrest Whittaker type) who help him get through his daily doses of crime and maiming.  Let's talk about the story...it was a normal day at the Washington Day school, until two students, Maggie Rose Dunne, and Michael \"Shrimpie\" Goldberg are kidnapped. Their favorite math teacher, Gary Soneji takes them, burries them in the ground and demands a huge ransom.  These two students were children of the most prominent families in the area.  Alex and Sampson are taken off a brutal crime in the D.C. area and forced onto the Goldberg-Dunne kidnappings.  Everyone gets involved.  Secret Service, FBI, and the Washington police all try to work together to solve the crime.  This book has so many twist and turns, and plots within plots, it will make your head spin.  Every page you turn reveals something new and exciting.  Even when Gary Soneji is caught....nobody is sure who is responsible...Gary seems to have a split personality (Remember Adam Stampler from \"Primal Fear\") and the outcome of his trial is questionable.  You have to read this book...Alex Cross books like this one, and \"Kiss the Girls\" are movies now, but they never let you see Alex in an intimate way.... he has a loveable family, his best pal Sampson, and lots of juicy romances.  All of these are left out of the movies.  Why? because Patterson wants you to see the movie...love it...and then read the books..because he KNOWS you too will like it better than the movies and read the whole series.  I promise, the books are really are not comparable to the movies.</td><td>Oh Alex!

I hate that. Dr./Detective Alex Cross, a Washington DC forensic psychologist/gumshoe and his partner, John Sampson, are assigned to investigate a double kidnapping with the FBI and Secret Service. The victims are Michael and Maggie, the former the young son of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and the latter the young daughter of a movie star. Very early on, the reader knows the identity of the perp, a brilliant serial killer named Gary Soneji, and Michael's fate. As Gary continues his murderous swathe across the landscape, all wonder. How do we catch this guy, and where's Maggie? The best thing about this thriller is Cross, a world-weary widower who loves his kids and his grandmother, and who's not afraid to be, in the honorable tradition of Eastwood's Dirty Harry, a thorn in the side of his boss and the mayor. You gotta love the guy. Also, the Maggie character was endearing, but author James Patterson gave her too little press time. The main problem with the book is that, at 502 pages in paperback, it's about 50 too long. By the novel's end, Gary's essential evilness and the de rigueur plot twist have been diluted out by an overabundance of other bad guys and the relationship between Cross and Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan, which Patterson develops ad nauseam. Moreover, for the apparent sake of maintaining the potential for a series, a major thread is left hanging. It's as if the author, or his editor, didn't know when to quit. Less would have been better. The movie version of ALONG CAME A SPIDER was recently released, starring Morgan Freeman. From the trailers I've seen, the film adaptation seems to be a different story entirely. (Gee, what a surprise!) Besides the opportunity to observe the great actor Freeman, I'll want to see if the output of some Tinseltown scriptwriter can force both my thumbs in the same direction.

Everyone involved does a great job; Morgan Freeman plays Alex Cross with extreme emotion, Monica Potter is decent as secret agent Jezzie Flannagan, and Micheal Wincott is perfect as psycho-kidnapper Gary Soneji.

I was so disappointed when they cast Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross.  Alex in the book is MUCH younger.  There are so many aspects of Alex's life and character that were left out to accommodate the elderly movie Alex -- such as Alex's children, grandmother, relationship with a character in the book, etc... (don't want to give too much away - *wink*) That was a HUGE turn off to me when the movie came out.  Because this is my favorite book, I do not want to draw comparisons between the book and movie.

The kidnapper attempts to recreate The Crime of the Century(Charles Lindeburgh), by kidnapping the daughter of a senator. The senator is not a very prominent one at his postion, so this move baffles detetives on how he plans to create the crime of the century with just a senators daughter.

The year started out with the amazing Sean Penn film starring Jack Nicholson \"The Pledge\". It was then followed by Ridley Scott's sequel to \"The Silence Of The Lambs\", \"Hannibal\". We then had Robert DeNiro and Ed Burns star in \"15 Minutes\" now along comes \"Along Came A Spider\", which might not be as good as \"The Pledge\" and\\or \"Hannibal\", but it does prove to be a very entertaining film. It's a movie that's filled with lots of twist and turns and we go along with them, loving it! Back in 1997 we were first introduced to the character created in James Patterson's novel and the film version of \"Kiss The Girls\". Morgan Freeman under the direction of Lee Tamahori gives a wonderful performance. Freeman is an actor that truly has a presence that dominates on screen, no matter whom he's acting against. And that presence is very clear to see in this movie. The film opens up with a very exciting scene showing Freeman and his partner in action going after some rapist (I think). Right from that very first scene the viewer knows that they're in for a very suspenseful,exciting, and entertaining ride! A senator's daughter has been kidnapped dispite efforts by Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) who seems to work well in her scenes with Freeman. Flannigan (Potter) has been watching Megan (The senator's daughter) for 3 years. And can't believe how they're suspect Soneji (Michael Wincott) could have escaped. After a phone call from Soneji himself, sorta requesting that Detective Alex Cross (Freeman) take on this case, we are set to believe that for the rest of the movie Soneji is our man. But, the screenplay by Marc Moss has something else up it's sleeve. A major twist happens that sets us in a completely new direction. If someone can actually tell me that they saw what was going to happen in the end, then I must be the biggest moron walking around. Because I was shocked! If it wasn't for the plot twist, I don't think I would be recommending this movie. A lot of critics are complainng that the movie has too many plot holes. To them I say...LOSEN UP!!!! I've yet to actually see that is without any doubt absolutely perfect. The movie is entertaining. It keeps our attention, and has an ending no one will see coming. It's enjoyable, and exciting and I think people will like it for what it is, and will have a good time watching it.</td><td>A \"Spider's\" web of twist and turns!</td><td>987206400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-04-14</td><td>Sat </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>35</td><td>430</td></tr><tr><td>73764</td><td>1.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A2GHZVX5RY6DTC</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Some dorm buddies and I were bored last weekend, so we decided to go see something. It just happened that the \"something\" was this ridiculous waste of time and Morgan Freeman's acting ability (which should be a crime). I never read the book, as I am not a Patterson fan, so I can't compare the two. All I know is... After the very cliched prologue (i.e. the part that has nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the movie), the movie doesn't deviate from the cheap-o thriller rut. Freeman does what he can with the painfully bad dialogue, but to no avail. This was so predictable I found myself doing a mental checklist of coming events (killer calls NOW!....check.....twist comes NOW!....check). The worst part is the so-called, much-hyped twist. A good mystery gives you suspects and clues to foreshadow twists (Usual Suspects, 6th Sense), but this is one of those cheating movies that throws a totally unexpected twist that is, at first, shocking. After thinking briefly about the twist, one realizes that there IS NO WAY TO SEE IT COMING. The writer just decided \"hey this is suprising\" and threw it in, depite the fact that it makes NO SENSE. Plot holes are common, but what if the entire plot is a gaping wound bleeding ineptitude?</td><td>Atrocious</td><td>987897600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-04-22</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>36</td><td>217</td></tr><tr><td>73763</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1YYDSYUCHX5HJ</td><td>0006476155</td><td>William H.

Patterson has given us a hero with flaws, a wonderful family and personal relationship with his friends, a man with moral conviction and a fierce determination to bring criminals to justice. \"Along Came a Spider\" is the first in the series and it is a whopper of a tale.  We meet the extremely heinous Gary Soneji, a murderer, a kidnaper, who seemingly can't make any mistakes.  He kidnaps the children of a prominent politician and a movie star, and then proceeds to feign his crimes under the \"multiple personality\" umbrella.  What a sickie! What makes Patterson so great is that he weaves tales with brisk, short chapters; characters that have more than one dimension, and a wonderful sense of timing.  He pulls lots of plot twists, not quite as sinuously as Jeffrey Deaver, but still they are lulus!  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying these books.  They are the creme de la creme of the lot! Enjoy, but be prepared to get hooked. One aside:  I agree that the casting of Morgan Freeman as Cross in the two films is questionable.  Freeman is a marvelous actor, but I think casting a younger actor, such as Denzel Washington or even Cuba Gooding, Jr., would have allowed the movies to follow the books' characterization more fully.  But don't blame Freeman.  He does an outstanding job, as always.

The villian in the novel is intelligent, cunning, and very dangerous, and so the hero in return must also be intelligent, and insightful.  Patterson succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat through out much of the book, and I found most of his twists, and turns very entertaining.  Sadly what I did not find entertaining, intelligent, or even fresh was the routine use of the \"Black vs White\" mentality used by the star of the book Alex Cross.  I found the use of this really insulting, and it turned me off almost to the point of putting the book down. I could not understand why its inclusion made this a better book, or a better character.

First I want to give this book 3 stars but since I start to read his second Alex Cross novel 'Kiss the girls' I found that James Patteson is one of the greatest mystery novelist. The plot is good and reasonable, it has unexpected twists but in the middle of the book after kidnaping, it seemed as Patterson didn't know how to continue the idea he has started with. So there is like 100 an plus pages you can easily skip, but the ending is unexpected and really surprising. It's just somehow irritating as suspense novel is everything but taut in the place where you want to let your dog starve for a day and your finacee is waiting for a ball game just for you, but you are in your own universe.  The serial kidnaper is an intelegent person and so the hero needs to be, so this is a good premise which run well in the novel. As it's his first novel, you can see that character of Alex Cross isn't build-up very well yet, so sometimes the hero reacts or behave in out-of-logic manner and in some parts of the book he's not so belivable. Story is well buid, there is enough of suspense and unusual twists.

Not a truly original plot to begin with, but Patterson turns what you think is boilerplate into a tale containing enough twists to keep you turning pages well into the night!  When the kidnapper is thwarted by an accidental death, and the $10,000,000 ransom is never recovered even when the perpetrator is caught, the story begins to turn into a wonderful thriller that keeps the reader clueless until far into the book, something not many authors can achieve.  Is our criminal suffering from multi-personality disorder or is he an actor worthy of an Oscar?  Where is the surviving kidnap victim?  Has love found Alex Cross?  Is the FBI baffled or merely inept?  Why are the authorities so nonchalent?  After they have the kidnapper in custody, why don't they ask \"where is the child\"?  Has Alex Cross been taken in by a cunning, conniving con artist?  I won't tell you, but you must find out for yourself.  Any true mystery fan owes it to himself to read this book.  Are you the sleuth you think you are?  Find out for yourself.  If you weren't hooked on Patterson prior to \"Along Came a Spider\" you will be after you've read it.  Oh!

One of the great things about this series and Along Came a Spider in particular is the complexity of the story line and the substance of the characters. Unlike most other crime/thrillers this one has a main character with values. I don't know how many times I have read a story about the main character having an afair or doing something immoral. Alex Cross is as true as they come. His family life is nicely depicted  along with his friendship with his partner. Alex Cross is such a complete character its hard to believe he isn't a real person. He is a true hero in every sense of the word. The recent movie that came out isn't nearly as good as the book. It really isn't very much like it either. READ THIS BOOK!!

Who is the bad guy?  Will Alex lose this partner in his attempt to locate the Senators lost daughter? Who will die and who will survive? Alex Cross is in a race with time, and he does battle with the unique mind of a serial killer as well as a set of bad guys that comes as a surprise in the end.  Be ready to begin reading and not stop until you have reached the end.  I highly recommend this book.</td><td>A taut thriller say the author of $oft Money</td><td>991094400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-05-29</td><td>Tue </td><td>May</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>47</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>73714</td><td>3.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>AZB2XL16IA1XA</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>an unassuming way to spend a couple of hours - but don't expect much more.  good for a date, because there will be some moments when you cling - but not so many that you won't have time to get replenishment refreshments. i can't quite figure out why this film doesn't work.  it starts off with a good beginning that is supposed to explain why alex cross (morgan freeman) is so disaffected towards his work.  problem is that you just don't believe it.  i'm not sure if this is because of bad acting (which is uncharasteric of freeman's work), bad writing (the likely culprit) or weak directing (clearly a strong assist).  in any case, all it takes for dr. cross to get back into the swing of things is a call from a psycho kidnapper.  hey, if we only know... the plot holes grow from there.  frankly, i didn't really care.  partially because i wasn't all that engaged, partially because i wasn't expecting that much.  pacing of the film is uneven with some parts getting pretty dull.  the ending is ludicrous - you could count the plot flaws, inconsistencies, and holes, but you'd quickly run out of fingers.  the most annoying part is the barnaby jones approach.

They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me.  It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity. The scenes are also dull and choppy.  I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere. I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author.  I am glad I borrowed them from the library!

That film featured him playing as Alex Cross, a detective solving a mystery with enough plot twists to keep things interesting throughout.  It wasn't the best movie ever made.  It wasn't the best movie in the thriller/mystery genre.  But it was fun to watch more than once.  And that's what I can say about \"Along Came a Spider.\" The movie begins with Alex Cross losing a partner.  One might say it was his fault.  He feels that way, at any rate.  And so he goes into a slump where he just sits around building ships.  This is the character development that sets things up for the rest of the movie.  But that opening scene rather fails, mostly because--and this is going to sound stupid, but it's true--the special effects are so achingly bad.  If they release a 'look how we did this' feature on the DVD, people will say, \"Uh, it was OBVIOUS how you did that.\" And yes, that's a bad thing.  At any rate, it gets things going. Once the ball is rolling, the audience watches as a little girl is kidnapped by a criminal who craves fame.  To get that fame, he drags the reluctant but famous Alex Cross into the scene.  And so Morgan Freeman gets to show that he's very good at this kind of role.  He's on the case, accompanied by Monica Potter.  And though lots of people thought she did a terrible job in this flick, I thought she did wonderfully. As the hypothetical member in the audience watches, the movie takes him or her through a number of intriguing plot twists.  This just wouldn't be a movie about the Alex Cross character without those.  And the plot twists are very cool.  They mess around with your head, which I rather like.  However, some of them felt hollow simply because after they happen, you sit there and go, \"Yeah, that's nice, but as I viewer it would have been nice if I were privy to that information.\" In other words, you're stunned simply because you didn't know how some things functioned. The real thrill doesn't come from fearing who will die next--this is seldom a problem, except where the little girl is involved--but in seeing how Alex Cross attempts to outwit the deadly mind behind this whole affair. So what it comes down to is this: if you enjoyed the basic setup in \"Kiss the Girls\" (that is, mystery, plot twists, light action from time to time), you're going to think that this is just as good, if not better.  If, however, you like tons of explosions and a lot of action, pass on this one.  It's a great movie, certainly, but nothing you can feel good about unabashedly recommending to every last friend you have.</td><td>Great but not ground-breaking</td><td>994636800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-07-09</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>52</td><td>505</td></tr><tr><td>73701</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>APR3XUARXTZV6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Terre</td><td>Like all the James Patterson Books, and the Alex Cross books in particular, you are drawn into the story from the very start.

I seriously read the last 150 pages in a blur, I don't think I even took a bathroom break.

Why, oh why, would a producer pay big bucks to a best-selling author for the rights to film his book, only to twist the plot into unintelligibility? James Patterson, author of the eponymous book, is perhaps the most uneven writer working today, but Along Came a Spider (the first book to introduce Detective Alex Cross) was a superb thriller--unquestionably one of his best. Why screenwriter Marc Moss and director Lee Tamahori tried to improve Patterson's story is beyond me. Frankly the plot twists they added simply don't make sense. This is the kind of film you enjoy while you are watching it, then within an hour or less you start questioning why things happened as they did. I'll not spoil the suspense for those interested by enumerating these details, but even the strength of the book's characters get the Hollywood treatment. The brilliant villain Gary Soneji is rather sidelined in the film, while Patterson liked him so much he brought him back in another Alex Cross book. The cast are the saving grace of the movie. Morgan Freeman does a fine job reprising his role as Alex Cross. Although in Kiss the Girls I thought he was rather too old for Cross (and he's certainly no younger now!) he seemed more convincing to me in Spider--perhaps I'm simply detaching his portrayal from my mental image. Monica Potter, as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan, bears a resemblance to a younger Julia Roberts and sounds uncannily like her. Michael Wincott, as Soneji, was fantastically evil, the highlight of the film. I look forward to seeing much more of him. Some final thoughts: the opening scene has some of the least convincing computer generated images seen onscreen in ages. This certainly isn't a reason to miss the film--the scene is almost entirely incidental to the rest of the movie (and not even in the book at al) and if you come in 5 minutes late you miss nothing--but I have to wonder why more care wasn't taken. And the musical score, by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the Hollywood giants, is not his best work by far. The music of the closing credits worked well, but there was a curious mis-match between music and scene in most of the film. Finally, in the opening credits the vowels drop down into the actor's names on CGI spiderwebs--a single textured filament, like a spider descending on its thread. I have to admit to almost laughing out loud at what was obviously supposed to be dramatic, but when the capital \"A\" dropped down I couldn't help but think it looked like a zipper... All in all, it's worth waiting for this one on network TV.</td><td>Arachnophobia</td><td>999388800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-09-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>60</td><td>469</td></tr><tr><td>73683</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ABIT7MDWKONPK</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Ryan</td><td>This is the first and what I think is the best Alex Cross novel.

I did not see the movie, but had envisioned Denzel Washington to play the smooth and sophiscated Alex Cross and was disappointed in the choice of Morgan Freeman.  But after reading this book, Morgan Freeman fits Alex Cross in this book perfectly - for this book only!!! I love Patterson's books and have read just about all of them.  I find them to be engrossing, suspenseful and I just can't put them down.  He foils me with the ending each and every time!! In this book, Patterson has a serial killer at large, Gary Soneji, who has kidnapped two children, and who wants to be known as somebody. Jezzie Flannagan from the FBI, is also on the case, giving Cross support to capture the killer.  Three great strong main characters, exposed to the reader so as to get into their psyche, yet intertwined with each other to make for one incredible story.

Litton</td><td>If you happen to be a fan of \"Kiss the Girls,\" the 1997 surprise hit thriller, then you may be a bit disappointed in its prequel, \"Along Came a Spider,\" which pits Dr. Alex Cross against yet another kidnapper who has an agenda to be dealt with. As Dr. Cross, Morgan Freeman makes the film watchable at best, but the ominous presence of loopholes, twisted logic, and the overall way in which the movie toys with the audience, results in slight disappointment. The movie opens with a chase sequence that serves little purpose other than to set up a time of emotional turmoil in Cross's life, after the death of his partner as a result of this pursuit. His personal war against himself is put on hold when he discovers that a young girl, the daughter of a Senator, has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper wants Cross on the case. Teaming up with Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), who was the child's guardian at the private school she attended, the two of them begin sorting through the clues and details involving the kidnapping, trying to get a lock down on the whereabouts of the teacher they believe responsible. To say that the movie makes a mistake by revealing the kidnapper's identity is a misfire, but the fact that we know who he is doesn't enhance the plot, either. The movie is a sea of loopholes, from the solving of clues to the realization that the kidnapper may not be working alone. Consider a scene in which Cross goes through computer video in order to find a clue to the villain's whereabouts. He goes from searching through a classroom to a live computer camera that is based in the kidnapper's apartment, without any logical explanation for this transition other than a mere piece of dialogue from an extra to explain that what he is looking at is no longer recorded video. In another scene, Cross has a conversation with the kidnapper about a ransom exchange that took place in an earlier sequence on a subway train. The amount of the money was a mere ten million dollars, but Cross congratulates him for his retrieval of twelve million. This is one of the movie's more admirable twists, letting us in on the fact that since our villain seems to know nothing of this ransom, then there must be someone else involved. There are plot points that work, and those that don't, and in the end, the movie has toyed with us a little too much. \"Kiss the Girls\" toyed with our expectations, too, but allowed us time to build our own conclusion before throwing it back at us, all the while keeping our interest peaked. \"Spider\" toys with us in ways that leave little time to draw any sort of conclusion about what is going on, leading up to a particularly effective surprise twist ending that doesn't cheat according to the rules the plot has set up, though is somewhat hindered by the heightened disinterest in the lead-up. It's good to see Morgan Freeman back in such fine form; as Dr. Alex Cross, this is the Freeman we all know and love. His ability to instill calm in the most tense of situations is remarkable, and his solving of the crimes is shown in an intelligent, capable light. I will refrain from commenting on the acting of Monica Potter, so as not to reveal what happens, but I gather that the audience will make their own decision about her acting in the beginning and the end once the ending arrives. Michael Wincott is an ideal villain, and however little of him we get to see, his performance is remarkably chilling. In the end, \"Along Came a Spider\" is worth it for Morgan Freeman's acting, and some key plot points, but the overall effect the movie has is disappointing. The plot twists of the movie feel more like obstacles than advancements, while the central mystery never reaches a fully interesting fever pitch until the end. There are things that work and things that don't in this film; unfortunately, they never reach a healthy medium.</td><td>This spider's web is too sticky.</td><td>1001462400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2001-09-26</td><td>Wed </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>65</td><td>693</td></tr><tr><td>73663</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Michael Crane</td><td>I probably would've enjoyed this movie a lot more if I had seen it before reading the book.  Most of the time, that is the really big disadvantage of reading the book before seeing the movie.  \"Along Came a Spider\" was an okay movie, but it could've been a lot better. When a insane lunatic decides that he wants to be famous, he kidnaps a daughter of a senator.  After that, he contacts Alex Cross, and invites him to join his little game.  After trying to get away from the detective life after he had lost his partner, Cross knows he's back in the game, and that he may be the only hope the little girl has.  As he goes through a series of clues, Alex Cross realizes that the man who kidnapped the girl does not want money, he wants fame.  He wants to commit the crime of the century.  Now, Alex has to find out what exactly the kidnapper plans before it's too late. The book was a lot more suspenseful and thrilling than the movie.  The book was also a lot more sick and disturbing.  The kidnapper played by Michael Wincott, (who is also the bad guy in \"The Crow\", and \"Metro), should've been more dangerous and psychotic, just like he is in the book.  In fact, if you read the book and picture Wincott as the kidnapper, it will send chills down your spine.  There were a lot of great things that happened in the book that don't even appear in the movie!  The very beginning of the movie seems very phony and fake; you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  The DVD should've had more special features as well.  The only ones I could find were the theatrical trailer and a documentary on the making of the movie. Is this movie suspenseful?  Does it have some startling twists?  Does this movie keep you on the edge of your seat?  Yes, it does all of that, but not as well as the book does.  If you're more into movies than books, then see it.  If you like books better, read the book instead.

While I liked the cast, I just thought that there was TOO much jam-packed into the movie. Not enough character development to feel the actors out and not enough to sympathize with the situations.

The scene caught my attention and my interest, but as the story steadily moved towards the ending, i began to feel that i have seen these scenes before. the ending is not really that shocking partly because Potter didn't act very well in this film (under-acting, as opposed to over-acting, kills some performances). And it's this kind of movie that shows whether an actor/actress is really all they're made out to be. When an actor (morgan freeman) stars in a lackluster film and is still a good actor, then that is a trademark of greatness. the other actors/ actresses do a fair job, but the kidnapper needs special mention because he does an excellent job, very convincing. I liked Kiss the Girls, perhaps because Ashley Judd is a much better actress than Potter is, but also perhaps because the story was more solid. While this film is attempting to shock us and throw a twist at every scene, it fails to really make us care about any of the characters. Now that ive said all that, I must say that this movie's first act (you'll know what i mean when you see it) is much better than its second act. if the movie would've maybe stuck a little closer to the nature of the 1st act then i would've given this film 4 stars - but instead the film drivels off into cliched territory where i don't really care what happens next. Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors alive right now, he has incredible timing, ive never seen him over-act or go out of character. He can literally play any part (he's even played a bad guy, such as nurse betty or hard rain). however, even freeman can't save this movie from mediocricy, but he does make this movie a worthwhile rental...</td><td>caught in a spider's web...</td><td>1003536000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-10-20</td><td>Sat </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>75</td><td>313</td></tr><tr><td>73648</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2887J6P8VPB5H</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Nichomachus</td><td>What an uninspired work!

He needs a good badguy role; a real SOB role where he blows up a lot of stuff. Monica Potter is atrociously boring as the Secret Service sidekick. Her tepid performance is indistinct to that of her 'Patch Adams' character, which was a mind-bogglingly bad movie on so many levels. In 'Spider,' she tags along and whines with all the emotive ability of a seventh-grader. The badguy/kidnapper had the potential to be interesting; diabolical even. This would have made the twist even more compelling. However, his motivation is never explored beyond the *he's playing a game, and he's very methodical* schtick. I must say that the twist is really well-done, if kind of ridiculous. They didn't have to make the movie totally incomprehensible to pull it off. However, they didn't leave enough time in the movie to really get into the depths and motivations behind the twist, but by that point I was ready for the whole thing to end.</td><td>Bland & monotonous; good twist, though</td><td>1003622400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-10-21</td><td>Sun </td><td>Oct</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>76</td><td>214</td></tr><tr><td>73649</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AXA7OH47LBXZ7</td><td>0006476155</td><td>A Positive Guy</td><td>This is a movie that started out with a good, but predictable plot and somewhere around the middle grabs you and doesn't let you go until the last minute of the movie.

I got interested in Patterson after I read and saw \"Kiss the Girls.\" I read ACAS and was totally amazed. It was one of the best books from a new author that I'd read in a long time. The novel begins with a serial killer kidnapping two children from an exclusive private school where he teaches. Detective Alex Cross is hired to find the missing kids. This being the first Alex Cross novel, Patterson portrays him amazingly. Cross is the most intelligent, noble, and kind man that has ever existed in fiction. No matter what Alex Cross book you're reading, even if the plot is horrible, you'll enjoy the book just because Cross is in it. He brings so much to the novel, with his excellent detective and psychologist skills to the love he openly shows for his partner, his grandmother, and his two young children - the latter of the three being the most admirable. Reading scenes between Cross and his children is just so touching...or maybe I'm just being too much of a girl. :) Anyway, back to the novel. In the infinite world of psychos in novels, Patterson knows how to creep us out. Gary Soneji, the killer in ACAS, is a frightening and disturbing character that adds all the suspense needed for the novel. He is a smart killer obsessed with committing the crime of the century. \"Along Came a Spider\" will send chills through the reader's body and keep their eyes open, alert and glued to each page until all hours of the morning. It is solid, compelling psychological thriller.</td><td>And along came James Patterson...</td><td>1005782400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-11-15</td><td>Thu </td><td>Nov</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>79</td><td>311</td></tr><tr><td>73643</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A24DBUIAWDQXA2</td><td>0006476155</td><td>S.

Customer</td><td>This book was a slam dunk.  I am glad it was the first Patterson (featuring Cross) book that I read because it set up a lot of things that might have seemed odd or inconsequential later.  Now that I have read all the books in the series, I rank this one and KISS THE GIRLS as his two best. Much has already been said by others ... about the thrilling plot, the surprises and etc., so I will focus on two aspects of the book that have remained with me long after reading.  The first is the deft insertion of social commentary in the book.  When I first read the book, I thought James Patterson was African American, and I mean that as a compliment.  He became Alex Cross, and Alex Cross is a black man with real life black man problems aside from solving serial killings.  His family is authentic; his associations with black and white people; his romances (with white and black women) without being condescending, cute, or stereotypical--I should maybe write more about this category it was handled so well without making Cross a whitegirl chasing Tom, despite his affair with Jezzie, good job, good job, good Job Mr. Patterson; his reluctance to be pulled off a case involving working class blacks to solve one involving elite whites.  In short, his attitudes about things is not typically black, but typically Alex Cross, who happens to be black.  Get it?  He is real first.  And he is black second. The second aspect that burns long after consumption is Soneji/Murphy as a husband and father in suburbia.  There is humor, humanity, and lurking danger in these scenes.  I kept praying that when he finally snapped--which I suspected was coming and boy was I right--that he wouldn't hurt his daughter.  Patterson pulls no punches, and reading these scenes I began to buy why a man with such a regular looking life (dull normal life) might secretly be a serial killer.  Just looking for fun.  OK, that's sort of a simplistic assesment of Soneji/Murphy's particular psychosis, and to understand him better, we would probably have to consider what we know about his Freudian footnoted childhood on his grandfather's farm and whatnot.  Nevertheless, Soneji/Murphy is scary BECAUSE he is looking for fun, on some level.</td><td>Just Looking for Some Fun</td><td>1008374400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2001-12-15</td><td>Sat </td><td>Dec</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>84</td><td>399</td></tr><tr><td>73638</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A127PCLKOSDS04</td><td>0006476155</td><td>J.

This film however struggles to make a lot of sense, and limps along despite him being in the starring role. It is set in a sort of phantasy world of super criminals and heroic police. A senators daughter is kidnapped by someone who has devoted most of his life to working up to this crime. He is not interested in a ransom but rather in being respected by the Freeman character. All simply nonsense of course. Again the villian seems to have worked as a teacher for some years, not a high paying job but one that has allowed him to collect such assets that he can hide out in boats and mystery houses. It also strains credability that he has been a teacher for over a year wearing a rubber face mask. One should not give away the plot developments of the second half of the film, but in reality they stretch what is believable to the point that a film which starts out as fantasy moves into another dimension of hyper fantasy. The difficulty with such films is that as they become so contrived they lose the ability to manipulate the audience. A flim works if you feel for the victims, if the villians appear original or grab your imagination, if the main characters seem to do something right. In this film the villian appears to be a moron, the victim precocious and the solving of the crime artificial. An okay way to fill in a couple of hours but a film that is pretty much forgetable except for the dumb bits which stay with you for weeks after.</td><td>Contrived</td><td>1011398400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-01-19</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jan</td><td>17</td><td>17</td><td>86</td><td>287</td></tr><tr><td>73597</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AJDYDG7YZY9QL</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Stephen A. Haines</td><td>\"Detective\" films can be traps for the unwary.  A particular role can overwhelm the story, or the story can be so convoluted as to leave the actors no room to maneuver.  Spider comes closer to the second option.  The film's plot concerns the kidnapping of a Senator's daughter from a high tone prep school.  There are Secret Service types all over the place [including one in background reading a magazine, which is hilarious in itself], and the one in charge, Monica Potter, roundly berates herself for failing to prevent the snatch.  The kidnapper, who's not a child abuser, has taken the kid in a bid to match wits with Morgan Freeman, \"perp\" analyst Alex Cross.  Can the kidnapper keep Mika Boorem alive and well, while crossing psychic swords with Freeman yet still pull this caper off?  Will Freeman make a pass at Potter to salve the loss of his partner? It's both fascinating and depressing to watch how one performer of style and class can nearly redeem an inadequately structured film.  In Spider, Morgan Freeman, who has a full payload of both, is in a position to keep this film together, but isn't allowed to do it.  In his role, Freeman  must be able to weave tenuous threads to create personality profiles in narrowing down  suspect lists.  While there's little doubt Freeman could portray such a role with ease, we aren't really allowed to watch the process unfold in Spider.  Director Tamahori, however, is too busy weaving his own threads. In Tamahori's hands, James Patterson's novel becomes a jerky sequence of thinly connected scenarios.  The plot, which is full of wonderful surprises, follows multiple paths.  Like any spider's web, they only meet at the centre after some rather bouncy progress.  Boorem makes a praiseworthy effort to steal the film with her escape attempts.  Potter is fetching enough to distract from her mediocre acting.  Michael Wincott as the kidnapper might have been an excellent foil for Freeman, but the story won't let him.  The story won't let any one individual become outstanding.  On the other hand, the film is too short to let the story develop fully. We are left with a tantalizing result: a plot rich with promise, but too sketchy in its presentation, and actors who might have given award-winning performances had they been given the opportunity to develop the characters.  It's a shame, but you can't award stars for the things that didn't happen. Like so many detective films, there are numerous details that intrude on credibility.  How the kidnapper prepared for the snatch is easily the most astounding.  His \"hideout\" was positioned solely to create a crisis.  If he's intelligent enough to read and understand Cross' books, his blunders are inexcusable.  Without giving away the ransom payoff, someone please explain how the material was to be disposed of without detection.  What steps does Freeman take to work out who the villain is?  These quirks catch the viewer's attention, distracting from the film's value and the protagonists' performance.  The film is easily worth a viewing or two, but to buy it?

Most of my Kiss the Girls  review could be cut and pasted into this one, and that is the film's main failing; there's just not that much new here. The movie is a strictly paint-by-numbers mystery flick of the kind that seems to have been endemic over the past  couple of years. It's a good enough way to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but it ranks in the empty calories section of the video rental shelf: you won't take anything away from it. The film opens with the daughter of a Senator (Michael Moriarty) being kidnapped from her school. The kidnapper gets Cross involved in the investigation  by dropping a piece of evidence off in his mailbox and calling him. Jezzie Flanagan (Potter), who's been the Secret Service agent in charge of guarding the kid, latches onto him, and the two end up as partners in the  investigation. The plot twists show up exactly where you expect them, and should be predictable to anyone who's watched more than five mysteries between The Thirty- Nine Steps and Kiss the Girls. Everyone reacts the way you'd expect them to in every situation. Everything is safe and requires no thought.

Infact, without him this film probably would've been worse. \"Along Came A Spider\" definitly lacks the intrigue of other Freeman crime movies. This one just failed to capture my interest. I think the problem was that I was used to the creepy environments and the brutal murders that were strong in the previous Freeman movies. This one just lacked all that and the mystery.

His first several books were really stunning thrillers, up to and including Cat And Mouse. but since then all his Alex Cross books have just been re-hashings of the same old plots. This book is great. It's a chilling read, with an excellent and truly original plot. Alex Cross comes across as a great compassionate character, who has much life in him. But Unfortunately, patterson tired him out very quickly. With this book Patterson created one of his most chilling victims. He is chilling because Patterson spends time making him so. Developing his character. With his latest books, Patterson doesn't bother developing his villains )or ANY of his characters, for that matter) and just expects us to believe him when he says they are \"a chilling and terrifying killer\" and leaves it at that. With this book, he really shwos us what he can do. He is listening to his fans to much when they say \"can't you write faster\". He has chosen to do so, and in doing that has sacrificed good characters and original plots. This book was a great pageturner and a great thriller, with a really brilliant and unexpected twist right at the end. I cannot reccomend this highly enough. How i wish patterson had stayed with this kind of book, rather than started attending the Danielle Steel school of literature. (i.e. it doesn't matter about the quality, the more the write, the more you sell, so let's laugh all the way to the bank) A once great author. I hope he soon refinds his previous great form which he displayed here.</td><td>An excellent thriller</td><td>1015372800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-06</td><td>Wed </td><td>Mar</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>91</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>73589</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1NXGXR3RYV0Y6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Stephen S.

And in my opinion \"Along Came a Spider\" is his best Alex Cross novel and his first Alex Cross novel. After \"Kiss the Girls\" was made into a remarkable movie I couldn't wait to see what they would do with this and I was, to say the least, extremely disappointed. I can't completely judge the movie without being totally biased cause the book is just sooooo much better. The movie is ok and the people I saw it with liked it, those who hadn't read the book. But why they changed as much as they did and created a faulty storyline from a master plan, the book, is beyond me. The book is so much more complex and deep and requires a lot more thinking than this film allows. It's unsurprising twists make a joke out of the intelligence the book offers. I do wish film makers would take into consideration the merits of the book. If a book is a huge bestseller don't make a movie out of it that changes the story cause most likely your story won't be better. I will say Morgen Freeman is a great actor and I love watching him and he's good in this, but better in \"Kiss the Girls.\" Now I just pray the movie makers leave Alex Cross alone unless they stick to the books.</td><td>Read the book</td><td>1015804800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-11</td><td>Mon </td><td>Mar</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>92</td><td>246</td></tr><tr><td>73588</td><td>2.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>A152C8GYY25HAH</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Matthew Horner</td><td>Along Came a Spider is Morgan Freeman's second appearance as forensic psychologist Alex Cross. The first was in 1997's Kiss the Girls. This is not a sequel. Cross is a character in a series of books by James Patterson. Like the books they are based on, the movies are thrillers. All thrillers are not created equally, and Along Came a Spider is inferior to its predecessor. Freeman is as good as ever. The movie is full of surprises, and there are indeed some intense moments. The problem is the script. Whenever the movie tries to explain a previous scene, that scene is more full of plot holes than the one it is trying to explain. Still, the movie can prove enjoyable as long as you park your thinking cap next to the popcorn. The movie starts with a wild police pursuit in which Cross' partner is killed. Devastated, Cross goes into seclusion, uncertain whether or not he will be able to work again. Meanwhile, in a posh private school in the District of Columbia, student Megan Rose [Mika Boorem] is kidnapped by a teacher, Gary Sonji [Michael Wincott]. Megan is the daughter of a United States senator. This means that Jezzie Flannigan [Monica Potter], the Secret Service agent assigned to protect the girl, is in a lot of trouble. Cross, drawn against his will into the case, takes her under his wing, and the two set out to find Megan. The road they follow is full of dangerous twists and turns. Besides Freeman and those suspenseful scenes, there are some good elements. I liked Megan, because she is a kid with guts. She is as much heroine as victim, using her wits as often as possible. Wincott makes a convincing villain, effectively utilizing his sinister good looks. The photography is atmospheric and gives the movie a properly creepy look. It's too bad all the good parts of the movie don't make up for the confused plot. It is Sonji who calls Cross after the kidnapping and taunts him into coming out of retirement, but why he does this is never adequately explained. Sonji kidnaps Megan to get to his real target, Megan's best friend at school who is the son of the President of Russia. Why in the world is this kid in an American school? Why didn't Sonji just kidnap him in the first place? These are the kinds of questions many viewers will ask while watching the movie. A thriller generally works through suspension of disbelief. If you don't ask yourself questions until the movie is over, the movie succeeds in its mission. When the questions start during its first half hour, it hasn't done its job properly.</td><td>Only if you like thrill-less thrillers</td><td>1015891200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-12</td><td>Tue </td><td>Mar</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>93</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>73587</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>AYN77RSKL22P6</td><td>0006476155</td><td>L.

I've reed some good classics. Psycho is still one of my favourite, and i cherish Red Dragon. But this book is just awful. Everything is wrong. Everything. The serial killer is not beliveable. He doesn't act as a real serial killer shoudl act. There's nothing more horrible than a serial killer who makes jokes about cutting up someone's penis and shoving it up one's mouth. it's just too funny to come from a man who should be lonely, methodical, devoted to his work. Instead, he has a perfect family and a house with a garden. What happened to the real killers, those who hide human body parts in the basement or in the attic, who have sexual innibitions... who are just real? Then there's his intelligence. He's anything but, because the writer doesn't try to show us that by actions, but merely by telling us. As for the detective, Alex Cross, he's so transparent, without characterization. he spends his time complaining and beeing sorry for the victims. What about thrying to get the killer? Patterson's narrative are even worst. The prose is very simple, as if the readers were too dumb to understand. And then there's his subplots: all that stuff about racism, all seen by the eyes of Cross, who is black. I understand the message, but Patterson doesn't make it sound true. It's not like he ever suffered this problems in his own skin, is it? Thus, avoid this book. There are better thrillers in the market awiting.</td><td>What the hell is this thing?</td><td>1017532800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2002-03-31</td><td>Sun </td><td>Mar</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>94</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>73586</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1YCBVMFYBFEOY</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Seung H.

It's not one I have to watch again to figure anything out though, and that's what I gauge a good mystery by...nothing was subtle here and I could see where the story was going clearly. \"Sonji wouldn't ask for money if he had the money if he had the girl\" and then there was a ransom of 'money' asked for... well any mystery buff would have to figure...he must not have had the girl anymore...little things like that stood out.

However, let me set the record straight.  It is \"Along Came a Spider\" that really is the first of the now popular series by James Patterson, not the other one, so perhaps you should consider this as a prequel, not a sequel. As if to show that fact, this film opens with a botched undercover invetigation that ends with a miserably bad result. (And, let me say, so CGI generated car crash scene is.)  Flash forward, and now, feeling guilty of this failure, Alex Cross is thinking about retiring when he is forced to join in another investigation about a kidnapped girl of a senetor in a prestigeous school.  Then his partner turns out to be an FBI agent, who also experienced bitter taste of failed protection service, now feeling guilty as much as Alex.  They start to search for the clues about the girl's whereabout and the criminal's true purpose together until coming to a very unexpected ending of the story. You are to notice that the virtue of the film lies mostly in this unlikely pair of Morgan Freeman as Alex, and Monica Potter as his parter.  In spite of given little chance to reveal their inner characterizations before the audience, their highly convincing acting succeed to enhanse the value of the whole production by several notches, letting us forget the incredible happenings and prediatable settings in the script, which actually, differs radically from the original book, so don't tell anyone about how the story develops even to any of writer James Patterson's avid readers. (For example, villainous 'Soneji' meets another fate in the film version.)  Whether or not you've read the original, it is certain that you will be surprised to find the truth behind the kiddnapping case. Or you might cry out, \"You gotta be kiddin'!\" in which case, I agree, you are not to blame.  The story itself, if you write down on paper to summerize it, would be as believable as scientific theory in \"Independence Day\" or incredible disguise of Mr. Soneji's face -- didn't any one of the teachers there notice his cheesy make-up such a long time? -- but, there you are, you find yourself pretty much entertained by this train of thrilling set-pieces presented with a moody camera. After all, it is Lee Tamahori who is officially selected to do the next 007 series, not Tamanori who directed in his earlier days ruthlessly tough dramas.  This is, as a conclusion, a good timekilling thriller, as thrilling as the Mother Goose song, on which the title is based.  Enough to frighten away Miss Little Muffet away, but too much entangled for us to believe in the story.</td><td>Along Came a Spider to Little Miss with Too Entangled Story</td><td>1022457600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-05-27</td><td>Mon </td><td>May</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>481</td></tr><tr><td>73579</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A5TNZXNPQKGCF</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Barry Lee Dejasu</td><td>This was, simply, the best mystery/thriller book I've ever read.  Constantly kept me guessing, surprises around every corner, and superb characterization!

I liked the shifting viewpoint; you know, first person Alex Cross in one chapter, then third person somebody else in the next, and back and forth and so on.  Also, the very short length of the chapters was especially useful--I hate chapters that go on and on and on so you can't finish them in one night. I am verymuch looking forward to Kiss the Girls; I hope to finish reading all the Cross novels before the next one, FOUR BLIND MICE, comes out in November. And as for the movie, don't blame them!  This novel was HUGE, with LOTS of events and plot and scenes, so it's no wonder that they had to cut so much of it in order to cram it all into a 2 hour movie!  Blame the production company!  Paramount, I think.  In that case, there might have been at least a LITTLE justice.  The movie did fairly well considering how much of the plot it was able to get from the book...okay, maybe not a lot, but enough to make it's own story!!

There's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles, no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff, which was what I expected yet didn't get it.  The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters.  Yeah, I admit it, there are some very short chapters.  Lots.  But that doesn't mean that it's fast paced.  It's fast paced compared to Stephen King, but I think it's a slow paced book.  I want action.  I want adventure.  The killer kills a lot of people.  I didn't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out.  And also, Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller.  He failed miserably.  I don't think I've ever read a good detective novel...all I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes.  If you think this is fast paced, good for you.

The book has truly translated well onto the screen. Morgan Freeman does an excellent job; he plays the character of Cross much less stiffly than we have seen with other genius detective types.  Most of the time, they're so clinical and absorbed (sometimes self-absorbed) that it's difficult to watch them.  At least Denzel Washington was supposed to be stiff in THE BONE COLLECTOR. The strength of the movie relies heavily on a quick change-up surprise which occurs at about twenty minutes from the end of movie, which is good, because once you figure out that not everyone is quite as they seem (and we all know who's going to win), a resolution shouldn't be drawn out too long. I was impressed by Monica Potter's performance.  Most critics called her a copy of Julia Roberts, which isn't a bad thing necessarily.  There is one scene in which the character Soneji is finally killed, and we see some good acting from her, but not only is she a good actress, her character is a good actress as well.  I won't leak too much information, but when the turning point comes, the movie relies much less on Morgan Freeman as a power-actor and turns the spotlight onto Potter.  Michael Wincott, as Soneji, and Mika Boorem, as Megan Rose, also do fine jobs. The movie's not a classic, but the surprise twist does spin your head a bit, and you will definitely not see it coming, unless you've read the book and you know the Alex Cross formula.  It's a palpable thriller, and I can't wait for the next installment in the Alex Cross mysteries.</td><td>An effective slight of hand.......</td><td>1026604800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-07-14</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jul</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>105</td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>73574</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</td><td>0006476155</td><td>TheHighlander</td><td>I give this movie 2.5 stars because it is not bad but yet not really good.

They belong to those of a US senator and actor and then the manhunt for Gary Soneji begins. This was Patterson at his peak. His characyers were well developed, unlike his earlier novels, and Alex Cross especially. In this one he's portrayed as a black detective who struggles to raise his kids in the ghettos of Washington.

Kirkman</td><td>I enjoyed this book, the first of Patterson's Alex Cross stories. The book was very exciting and well written about a psychopath who kidnaps and kills people. The story begins with the character who is the crazy guy, Gary Soneji/Murphy who has multiple severe personality disorders along with being a complete nut-case due to his terrible childhood. Gary Soneji/Murphy plays a school teacher at a day-school for rich kids when his intent is really to kidnap and kill the Dunne/Goldberg children. And finally, one day he lured the children into his van and kidnaps them, drugging one and eventually killing the other child. This kidnapping has the whole DC area up in arms, and Alex Cross works day and night to capture Soneji/Murphy, but he doesn't do that until he kills a few more people in different places. His whole game throughout the book is that he \"Wants to be Somebody.\" He is the master of killing, and he enjoys the game. Alex Cross trys to help all he can, and he gets inside Soneji/Murphy's head and gets him to tell him all of his horrible little secrets after Soneji gets captured the first time and put into prison. Later though, Soneji escapes from prison and causes more problems. More than just Soneji/Murphy though, is an accomplice. Alex fell in love with a female detective on his team, not realizing that she is actually the one behind more of these problems with the kidnappings and knows the answers to what happened with the children.

The pacing is irregular, speeding up and jerking to a halt with no effects on the viewer than mild annoyance.  The \"twists\" are at once so predictable one could deliver the lines right along with the actors having had no prior information about the film and at the same time farfetched, and always unexplained.  Rather than challenging its viewers, it leaves us feeling like the filmmakers decided that they were too tired to fill in the blanks and decided to let the audience figure it out on their own.  And of course it doesn't matter why the characters do what they do, because we don't end up caring about them at all.  Still, when you don't feel like dissecting a movie, Spider takes you on a ride that is fun if completely illogical.  Monica Potter (Head Over Heels) is terrific and young Mika Boorem (Riding in Cars with Boys) delivers an impressive performance.  Boorem's character is not [stupid], either - she's conniving, clever and is one of the only characters who weighs the consequences of her actions before carrying them out.  It's nice to see that respect given to a child's role.  Morgan Freeman (The Sum of All Fears) as Det. Alex Cross is somehow still captivating, despite an annoying, unsympathetic character.  It's an enjoyable movie in its way.

Yet this mind-boggling and somewhat implausible thriller brings back Morgan Freeman to reprise his role as the brilliant forensic detective Alex Cross that he played in \"Kiss The Girls\" to such an electrifying effect. Of course, this whole opening sequence just lays the groundwork for the premise of the film, which is that Freeman's character has been sent into a tailspin, feeling personally  responsible for a colleague's death, and this self-enforced \"retirement\" from active casework becomes one of the provocative elements energizing the action in this thriller. thus, when an influential senator's daughter is kidnapped in broad daylight from an exclusive Washington private school, Cross is pressed into service in order to generate more ink and electronic media interest. Of course, some of the gee-whiz aspects of the plot are implausible, like Cross using advanced computer technology to virtually explore the topography of a suspect's room via a photograph, thereby discovering mind-boggling clues from that photograph that strain the credibility of the plot, but not to worry. We are quickly sped on our way toward another aspect of the developing story. Like the previous movie, there are a number of unanticipated plot twists here top keep one's interest, and the action sequences are very well done. The two aspects of rapid-fire action and a number of bizarre plot turn-arounds have one guessing right up to the end just what the blazes is going on. Like the prior film, it is also an interesting travelogue of the area in which it was shot, this time primarily around the nation's capital. After these two outings, one hopes to see Alex Cross (played by Freeman, of course) will return to truly establish this franchise with a while series of such movies.

I must say I absolutely loved the movie and wished the book would be just as good. The problem is that the events in this book span for so LONG (events take place in a period of almost two years). There actually are pretty good suspense scenes, but they are buried among pages and pages of Cross's reflections. I'm not saying this is bad -actually Alex Cross is one of the better constructed fiction characters I have ever come across- but it really slows down the action. I do agree entirely with one of the reviewers who wrote that the love scenes were tedious and one too many. Maybe it's because the book is so different from the movie (actually the movie just takes the beginning of the novel and then goes on it's own way until the end) or because I rather enjoy Jeffery Deaver's extremely fast paced Lincoln Rhyme novels, but this book didn't do it for me. This is my second Patterson/Cross novel. The first one was Pop Goes the Weasel which I didn't found that good either. I'd like to give the author another shot by reading Roses are Red or Cat and Mouse which seem to be the best books in the series but I just hope they are more of the \"roller coaster ride\" other reviewer's talk about.</td><td>Two and a half actually - not what I expected</td><td>1036368000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2002-11-04</td><td>Mon </td><td>Nov</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>114</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>73565</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A11M7JW9RKXCGN</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Lauren Adasiak Cocilova</td><td>The characters are colorful and interesting, the plot line is full of twists and intrigue, and I really enjoyed the book.

Both are part of a series featuring the psychologist-detective Alex Cross, a tough Washington DC cop. \"Along came a spider\" is an interesting book. It's the first one in the \"Cross series\", where the readers are introduced to the main characters that will make part in the series, like Cross, his partner Sampson, Cross family, etc. Patterson has a very peculiar style of narrative. His chapters are usually short, wich makes the reading very fast-paced and thrilling. Also, Patterson has two kinds of narrative: one in the first-person where we see what Alex Cross is experiencing and believing, and it's a very personal and one-sided narrative; the other style is in third person, where the reader follows the steps of the main suspect of the crime the story is about. So, to be clear, we KNOW who the killer/murderer/kidnapper/whatever is from the very beggining. Does this spoil the plot or the reading? No! Patterson is master in delivering sub-plots, twists, nuances about characters along the book, all very interesting, and they make the pursuit/manhunt very enjoyable. In \"Along came a spider\", Gary Soneji is the kidnapper fanatic about the Lindberg case, who intents to make history by taking away two very important children. Cross and his teammates in DC Police, FBI and Secret Service have to stop him before he strikes again. This is just the first plot of the story, and it keeps changing every ten or twenty chapters. One thing I found annoying, though, is that Patterson made Cross something like a super-human being. There were times when I thought Cross was virtually invincible. But that is something minor. What really matters is that Patterson created believable characters in one really good thriller. I will surely read the other books in the series, and I'm waiting for Patterson's incursion in medieval times \"The jester\".

But he eventually makes them larger than life and omnipotent to the point of being like Jason in the Friday the 13th movies.  Patterson also forgets his audience has most likely been exposed to a heavy dose of crime solving on TV and in the movies when he renders everyone except Cross so clueless when it comes to finding traces of the killers. Good thing for the rest of the country all serial killers find a way to involve Cross lest the rest of the nation's crime fighters spend all their time eating doughnuts while ignoring tools like DNA and fingerprints.

The plot centers on the kidnapping of a Senator's young daughter from her private school. The kidnapper then gets in touch with famed criminal psychologist Alex Delaware (Morgan Freeman)in an effort to impress him. Delaware has recently lost his partner due to a mistake on his part. To track down the kidnapper, he enlists the help of a beautiful young secret service agent (Monica Potter), who was stationed at the girl's school and is being blamed for the kidnapping. So both individuals are wounded from their past mistakes and anxious to succeed again. The movie then follows the twists and turns of the duo's efforts to solve the kidnapping. Several plot twists near the end (which I won't go into so as not to ruin the viewing experience) vastly improve the movie. The actors are very strong: Morgan Freeman is particularly moving as Alex Delaware and the young actress who plays the kidnapping victim, Megan Ann Rose, is wonderful. I would recommend this movie to those individuals who enjoy the thriller/mystery genre. While you certainly can find a better movie in this category, you also can find a number of poorer ones.

Despite a good story and pacing, however, I didn't find much about this novel to live up to the hype it has received by come. Many of the major characters, notably the \"mysterious\" FBI agent Alex Cross falls for and the children kidnapped, seemed undeveloped and hollow and didn't add anything compelling except to serve as filler characters. The serial killer featured was the lone high acclaim I have...reminiscent to the portrayal by Edward Norton of a killer in the movie Primal Fear, the antagonist in Along Came a Spider is compelling and intriguing, forcing the reader to make decisions that set up the later resolution. The actually \"twist\" ending, however, was disappointing to me as well. Most endings  have elements that were at least SOMEWHAT foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Patterson's ending, however, seemed to come out of left field and was completely arbitrary, with no connections to earlier in the story; in effect it didn't do the madman of the story justice.

No motivation for character's actions, incomphrensible police/forensic work, \"plot twists\" that come out of nowhere, etc. One of the worst -- the little kidnapped girl disappears from the kidnappers boat, but we are never told how this happens (she's locked in securely). Horrible CGI special effects that look cartoonish and totally phony. About all I can say positive is that Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott, along with Monica Potter, Michael Moriarity and several other good actors, try valiantly to use talent and charisma to make SOMETHING of the material, but with a script this incoherent they didn't stand a chance.

James Patterson brilliantly keeps up the tension throughout the novel. As with great stories like this the villain seems unlikely at first but all the clues are there and it all fits! Detective Alex Cross, a hardbitten black cop / psychology major from DC, is investigating a series of gruesome deaths in the ghettos of Washington when he and his partner get dragged off on a case involving the kidnapping from an exclusive private school of two children. One is the son of the secretary of the treasury; the other, Maggie Rose, is the daughter of a famous movie star. Initially Dr. Cross is annoyed at all the attention being focussed on the privileged but he finds himself getting dragged into the case. It appears that a Gary Soneji, a teacher at the school who was so well liked he was named Mr. Chips, kidnapped the children out of the blue. As the plot thickens, leads seem to connect to the ghetto killings, one of the children turns up dead, a ransom is paid and lost and the kidnapper proves elusive. Alex Cross, vilified for his role in the handing over of the ransom, finds solice in the figure of Jezzie Flanagan - the prime secret service minder of the two children. The relationship, crossing racial boundaries, adds more tension. The figure of Gary Soneji, the alter-ego of a Gary Murphy, is a brilliant creation up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter. At least you know where you are with Mr. Lecter - Murphy/Soneji keep you guessing all the way - scary! James Patterson brilliantly handles all of the threads, not letting any of them unravel and adding twist after clue after hint. The final unveiling of the villain is wonderful - suprising, but the clues are all there to find.</td><td>Keeps you guessing all the way</td><td>1070323200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2003-12-02</td><td>Tue </td><td>Dec</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>131</td><td>328</td></tr><tr><td>73525</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>If you were a HUGE fan of this book by James Patterson, then keep in mind this is merely based off the book.  There are parts that are left out of the movie that could've otherwise been included. The story is the same but other things could've been differentiated. Matt Whittman plays Gary Soneji, a kidnapper at a private school who kidnaps the senator's daughter. Morgan Freeman plays Detective Alex Cross on his trail. Monica Potter plays Jezzie Flanagan, Cross' alias in getting Soneji. I guess the first annoyance of this movie is that its only \"based\" off the book. So a lot is changed around.  The beginning starts off with Cross' partner (and it isn't Sampson for those of you who read the book) in a car with a killer and eventually action comes into play and she's soon killed off merely 5 minutes into the movie (not including the opening credits). There's the attention grabber...unfortunately the movie can only go downhill from there. Gary Soneji is very out of character. This isn't bad for those who haven't read the book.  But the movie fails to show depth to Soneji's character.  This isn't just Soneji but Alex Cross as well. The characters in the movie feel wooden at times.  The dialogue is pretty corny at times so likewise most characters feel the same. The other part that annoys me is in the book they constantly told you that Gary Soneji wanted to commit the crime of the century.  In the movie there is no motivation whatsoever so you wonder \"What is Soneji's motive?\"  \"Why is he doing this?\"  Believe me you'll learn that it isn't for money. The plot twist wasn't done too well either.  We're supposed to believe that the senator's daughter was kidnapped from the boat Soneji imprisoned her on when we NEVER see it happen!  You wonder how she got to her new location near the end of the movie. Lastly, the ending.  With a few exceptions its easy to say the ending is usually changed for the worst and in this movie IT WAS FOR THE WORST!  Alex finds the girl and then it just...ends. No falling action or resolution it just ends. If you really loved the book the movie will more than likely disappoint you. If you didn't read the book the movie has a \"Love/Hate\" relationship.  I'm sure that if you haven't read the book you could pull the movie apart.</td><td>Disappointment if you were really into the book</td><td>1075248000</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-01-28</td><td>Wed </td><td>Jan</td><td>49</td><td>1</td><td>132</td><td>422</td></tr><tr><td>73524</td><td>1.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>AKI86OM0M5QLV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amy B.</td><td>I love James Patterson novels with all my heart, but this movie is the epitome of why you should never see a movie based on a book.

I won't tell you who did the crimes, but I'm only saving you about five minutes of time: once you're that far into the movie, you'll have it all figured out. The movie borrows heavily from \"Seven,\" \"Silence of the Lambs,\" and another, much better Morgan Freeman movie, \"Kiss the Girls.\" That was also written by James Patterson, but the director managed to make it a decent movie anyway. Watch any of those, they won't insult your intelligence quite as much.</td><td>Save your money</td><td>1081468800</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-04-09</td><td>Fri </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>134</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>73522</td><td>4.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Lonnie E. Holder</td><td>It seems as though I am in the minority with this film.  I enjoyed the plot twists, though you had to follow them carefully.  If you were watching you could, in theory, figure out who the bad guys are, though you really do not have all the facts to truly figure out every detail, somewhat like a Sherlock Holmes story. Our story focuses on one Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), who has carefully planned to kidnap the daughter of U.S. Senator Hank Rose, unconvincingly played by Michael Moriarty.  The point of the kidnapping is not to kidnap Megan (Mika Boreem), but to get access to a foreign diplomat's son, who is good friends with Megan.  Mr. Soneji is, as might be guessed, a bit of a wacko.  He wants Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), a famous profiler, to chronicle the battle of wits between them.  Ultimately there is a showdown between the two of them, but the showdown does not reveal the location of Megan. The plot twists and thickens more, and yet, there were clues in several places, I thought.  I was quite puzzled when the security guards went running out the front of the school instead of just closing the gates.  Further, I thought someone would have at least tried to grab a car to follow the kidnapper.  Later, Jezzie Flanagan (Monica Potter) has a chance to shoot the kidnapper and does not, though she seemed to have a chance to wound him.  All these little tidbits hint at the convolutions within the plot that are revealed only near the end of the movie. The convolutions did entertain me, and I got much more enjoyment out of trying to figure out the plot than with gunshots and car chases.  However, I prefer \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Columbo,\" and \"Sherlock Holmes\" to movies with nearly all action and no intelligence in their plot.  When you watch this movie, you do have to pay attention or you will lose direction, and you will see more plot holes than there actually are.  I thought nearly everything was explained as the movie progressed, and the only plot holes were mistakes by those involved in the kidnapping of Megan. There were four standout actors in this film.  Morgan Freeman is excellent, as usual, as Alex Cross.  Michael Wincott is quite convincing as the marginally sane Gary Soneji.  Monica Potter brings a good balance of strength and vulnerability to her role as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flanagan.  The real surprise performance is by Mika Boreem as Megan Rose.  Megan tries very hard to get away throughout the movie, and uses her head continuously, incidentally saving her own life.  Mika's performance is better than many of the adult actors in this film, and bodes well for a future career in acting. It could just be that I'm getting older, and car chases and flying bullets just are not as enjoyable as they once were.  Or it could be that I just liked the intellectual challenge of unraveling the threads of the complicated plot.  In any case, this movie is clearly not for everyone, but I would love to watch it again.</td><td>Convoluted Plot</td><td>1082246400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-04-18</td><td>Sun </td><td>Apr</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>135</td><td>545</td></tr><tr><td>73521</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A3MV1KKHX51FYT</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Acute Observer</td><td>The daughter of Senator Rose is kidnapped by her \"teacher\"; another teacher is killed.

Not only will you enjoy the writing which propells the suspense and mystery, but you'll also enjoy the character development.

Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or `Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here). This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex.

To the movie: I have not read the Alex Cross novels, so I am not able to comment on the movies based on them being faithful or not to the book. I HAVE seen both \"Along Came A Spider\" and \"Kiss the Girls\" and I enjoyed \"Spider\" much more, even though KTG was a good stab at the thriller genre. Morgan Freeman inhabits Alex Cross more completely, and I suspect that my appreciation of his performance was a combination of his wonderfully intelligent acting and Lee Tamahori's direction.  This version of Cross is intelligent, compassionate, brave, and scarcely takes a wrong step.  He'd be a good teacher and a good person to go get a beer with.  And if some psychotic killer were on your trail - he's the guy you'd want tracking the killer. *WARNING! Silence of the Lambs Spoiler in this paragraph!* The writers of thrillers have begun doing cartwheels trying to out \"surprise\" all that came before.  I can't pinpoint when this began.... but do you remember the surprise in \"Silence of the Lambs\" when Hannibal Lector suddenly appears from beneath the sheets in the ambulance?  The story here throws in several twists, and although in the lesser thriller you can often sense the \"twists\" a country mile before it occurs, I found myself genuinely surprised several times. It is worth mentioning both the character and performance given by young Mika Boorem as Megan Rose, the kidnapped daughter of a U.S. Senator.  In many thrillers adults often behave as if they've been lobotomized, with victims giving killers ample opportunity to have their way and with killers who give the hero a boring explanation of their motives as they also give the hero plenty of time to get the drop on them.  Megan Rose is no such character.  She is smart, resourceful, and after being kidnapped she plainly has no plans other than escaping.  A handful of times she thwarts the villains in ways that would not be thought of by any of the adults you see on \"Jerry Springer\". Monica Potter stands up adequately next to Morgan Freeman's powerful performance as Jezzie, the Secret Service Agent who was supposed to be guarding Megan when she is kidnapped suddenly by one of her teachers at her upscale prep school.  It seemed a little odd to me that Alex Cross would be initially reluctant to form an alliance with a Secret Service Agent when in \"Kiss The Girls\" he doesn't have any problem with becoming investigative partners with an amateur - a medical intern. There are several sequences which I found clever and suspenseful, such as the one in which a ransom of a thermos full of diamonds is transferred to the kidnapper - I always wonder how kidnappers think they're going to get away with it when they're trying to ransom - for you to get your loot you HAVE to go to where the loot is, right?  And if the ransom is several million, won't the cops be waiting for you?  The way THIS kidnapper overcomes this dillemma is ingenious.... and I read on the IMDB that this sequence was based on a similar sequence from \"High and Low\" by Kurosawa. At one point Alex Cross finds himself in the kidnapper's house, looking at two years of work that went into developing the kidnapping plan and he plainly has some admiration. \"Imagine the patience...the dedication...\" he murmurs. Jezzie responds \"You sound like an admirer.\" \"Well, he's like a spider. I happen to like spiders.\" I happen to like movies with clever villains, clever resourceful victims, sequences that pay homage to Kurosawa, and smart characters and actors like Morgan Freeman. Plus you can buy it for less than a rental at Blockbuster....</td><td>4 1/2 Stars actually - This DVD is a bargain!</td><td>1098057600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2004-10-18</td><td>Mon </td><td>Oct</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>141</td><td>667</td></tr><tr><td>73514</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1VHK9A4VLJTHC</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Michael Beverly</td><td>I gave When the Wind Blows a horrible review and had only read one other book by Patterson, which was a terrorist thriller of average quality, when I decided to bite the bullet and try this one out. Obviously some people really like his style and stories, so I figured this one, made into a movie, couldn't be THAT bad.  I wasn't too disappointed, in fact, since I expected it to stink, I was actually a bit impressed. If you're into chick written mystery thrillers, then this one will probably appeal to you.  I tend to enjoy more meaty offerings, Caleb Carr's great historical murder thrillers come to mind and Scott Turow's mysteries (lawyer based).  These types of books really get into the characters and don't rely so much on the \"hyper\" plot with out of the world, head line grabbing stories. This book makes the same mistakes that I found in the decent thriller Absolute Power, in which stuff happens that really could never happen.  I understand that is one of the points of certain types of fiction \"Blockbuster\" fiction, if you will, but it doesn't have to be so over the top. In any case, this one's a fairly quick read, and not a total let down, as for those that give this book the kind of glowing \"best novel ever\" type reviews, well, I don't believe those people have read much fiction. The cover of the paperback copy I read of this title had a glowing endorsement by Nelson DeMille, who is a superb writer, I'd recommend all his books before going to this series, but if you're a quick reader with lots of time, I'm going to give this an okay recommendation.</td><td>Average thriller, over the top plot complete with holes</td><td>1102291200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2004-12-06</td><td>Mon </td><td>Dec</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>142</td><td>290</td></tr><tr><td>73513</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>A1EBSH1071FMOJ</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Gracey London</td><td>Definitely not worth the time investment. I don't read many thrillers--they're not my cup of tea--but as far as books in general go, this book was rather bad.  Maybe all thrillers lack emotional depth and run along flat, clich plot lines.  Or maybe this was just a bad thriller.  In either case, this isn't a book that I would recommend to any of my friends. It wasn't necessarily _bad_, but neither was it particularly good. There's a lot of unnecessary words in there.  I could have typed up a plot synopsis of 500 words in half an hour, read it, imagined it all happening, and gotten the same enjoyment that I did reading 500+ pages. The plot's on the clich side.  It's redeemed in part by the twist toward the end, which is nicely foreshadowed in the chapters immediately before it, but the location, the conflict and the resolution are all much too conventional. The writing style's quick and clean, and the chapters are short, which makes for fast reading.  Thank God, because if the style had dragged any more than it did, I probably wouldn't have gotten through the book.  I felt that I could've put the book down at any moment while I was reading and not felt the urge to pick it back up.  It didn't scare me, it didn't move me, didn't make me laugh or cry... I felt mild curiosity at times, but that was it. In a book this long, you'd think there'd be at least a sentence or two worth remembering.  The kind of perfect phrase or chapter ending that makes you sigh and go, \"Yeah, baby, now _that's_ good writing.\"  There was exactly one sentence in the entire book that made me stop and read it again, and that was \"Dreams are as powerful as the real world to our nervous systems.\"  And that's only because I've been having some crazy dreams of late and experienced that statement first-hand.  It's good enough writing, but not anywhere near excellent. _Along Came a Spider_ isn't a bad book.

Tresca</td><td>I knew of two movies involving the character of Alex Cross: Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls.  I've seen neither and was interested as to what this mini-franchise is all about.  Plus I think Morgan Freeman is the bomb and was thrilled to hear he was the movie lead. The movie starts out with Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) following his partner, a pretty female cop who is a passenger to a known serial killer.  It's all a clever sting (oh the insect metaphors, I can't help myself!), but the plan falls apart when the serial killer decides he'd like a little pre-warm-up activity from his passenger. In an inexplicable moment of vulnerability, Cross' partner starts wailing that she doesn't want her face shoved into the lap of a serial killer.  Which is understandable, but not what we would expect of a cop trained to go undercover as serial killer bait.  Sure enough, the bad guy discovers the cop's ploy when he finds her earpiece (whatever happened to wires?) and things go downhill from there. The cop draws a gun on her companion, who freaks out.  Or maybe it's the cop who freaks out.  She shoots him dead, the car spins out of control and lands on the edge of a bridge (or a dam, hard to tell).  She screams helplessly for Cross' help, who can't save her.  She plunges to her death. This makes Cross understandably morose about his profession.  What is his profession, exactly?  It seems he's a cop.  But he's written a book about serial killers, so perhaps he's a profiler.  Since I'm writing my own book about this very subject, I found it curious that Cross' expertise is never fully explained.  Every mystery author wants his good guy to be a Bob Ressler or a John Douglas.  But it takes work to pull off these men as actual people as opposed to walking caricatures of Sherlock Holmes. Fade to... Children of important diplomats and politicians are sequestered in a high-security school known as the Cathedral.  There, kids attend weird classes with projects like, \"find Charles Lindbergh on the Web in the smallest number of hops.\"  Get it?  Web?  Spider? I know, I was stunned by the connection too. As it turns out, the teacher of the class is actually a highly trained kidnapper, Gary Soneji (played by the gravelly Michael Wincott of The Crow and The Three Musketeers fame).  Soneji's been buried within the Cathedral hierarchy for two years using latex appliances and an amazing device that conceals his fingertips. We're never told where Soneji acquired these skills.  My guess is he was an ex-government agent of some country.  But the movie deems those facts unimportant.  What's important is that Soneji knows of Cross--he's read Cross' book, after all--and decides he will provide the kidnapping of the century by mimicking the kidnapping of the Lindbergh Baby. This of course means he makes an obligatory phone call, voice disguised, to Cross, thus dragging him into the plot. Soneji kidnaps poor Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), daughter of Senator Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty, of Law and Order fame, who only gets like three lines).  But really, Megan's just a ploy to get closer to another, more important child (Dmitri Stardubov, played by Anton Yelchin) of a Russian diplomat.  Imagine, if Soneji kidnapped the little Russian boy, there'd be an \"INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.\" Those words are expressed over and over.  We're never entirely sure what the implications are, but they sound really bad.  Why is the Russian boy in an American school?  Why would it create an incident?  Who is the kid's father, anyway? Bristling after the embarrassing loss of her charge, Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) is determined to catch the bad guy.  That's JEZZIE, not JESSIE, for some reason I cannot fathom. After all, it's thanks to her bumbling and another agent, Ben Devine (Billy Burke), that the Megan was kidnapped. Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker), another agent, is put on the case, for the sole purpose of insulting Cross and then barking orders at people. The character of Soneji seems awkwardly conceived.  Is her supposed to be a serial killer?  We discover that Soneji did burn down his parents' house when he was young, a trait that's definitely evident in serial killers.  He's most decidedly the \"organized\" type, capable of holding down a job, purchasing a boat, and doing a lot of other things that require an orderly, structured mind.  But he's so one-dimensional, so utterly focused on being known as a kidnapper, that his later confession about his past seems forced.  In essence, Soneji feels like a villain some writer (James Patterson wrote the novel, Marc Moss wrote the screenplay) whipped up to be a foil for our hero. It turns out the kids use \"Stego\" encryption to conceal the \"equivalent of passing notes\" in .GIF files that they send to each other in class.  Megan and Dmitri use it and Soneji does too.  He leaves clues to the kidnapping embedded in those .GIF files, revolving around Charles Lindbergh.  One of those clues leads to the World's Clearest Webcam, which focuses on a patch of wall in Soneji's home (!). It's a sad statement about the movie industry that many of the plot points that lead to the real bad guys have to do with incompetence on the part of the authorities.  There are several situations throughout the film where people don't do what they should to catch the bad guy, but the movie provides these moments as obvious, \"duh, they were incompetent on PURPOSE,\" examples. See, I was far too preoccupied with the fact that Soneji walks in and out of peoples' homes unchallenged, that he seems to know where everyone is at all times, to start questioning other stupidity like security guards not reacting fast enough or shooting when they should.  What's thrown out as proof of another, secret plan to make money off of a kidnapping is lost in the morass of confusing plot points.  In other words, if you're going to use discrepancies in character actions to reveal the mystery, everything else going on in the movie better be sewed up tightly. It isn't. The person who carries most of the movie is really Boorem, who plays a clever, frightened girl quite capable of escaping on her own, thank-you-very-much.  She manages not one but two major escapes from the bad guys without help from anybody.  Boorem's scenes are the best part of the film. Potter is suitably nervous and frustrated as a pretty agent, but she's a little too severe to empathize with.  That said, she has such a striking resemblance to Julia Roberts that it's distracting.  She has the same smile, same drawl, same arching eyebrows.  Potter just doesn't have the charm, but then again that might be appropriate for the plot. Then there's Freeman, who adopts the tired, world-weary narrative that he did better in Se7en and The Shawshank Redemption.  At one point, Cross has to run all over town at the kidnapper's whim, such that the scene becomes comical rather than compelling.  Freeman deserves better. Along Came a Spider tries to be serious, mysterious, action-packed, scary, and ironic.  We know this because the music forcefully tells us when those moments are.  But the movie just doesn't have a compelling plot to back it up. Even with the major twist mid-movie. In a lot of ways, the film reminded me of the Watcher.  And that's not a compliment.</td><td>Oh what a tangled Web we weave!</td><td>1114905600</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-05-01</td><td>Sun </td><td>May</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>144</td><td>1298</td></tr><tr><td>73511</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A2E9Q3T876TQ6C</td><td>0006476155</td><td>L.

Soneji is also known as Son of Lindbergh, a murdering serial kidnapper that has outsmarted most of Washington's law enforcement. I also must say that Soneji is one of Patterson's most diabolical villains to date - he doesn't torture his victims the way we saw the villain in KISS THE GIRLS do, but he is much smarter and that can be very scary all by itself! Because of Soneji's brainpower, he's kept ahead of the law in the past. Now Alex Cross is on his trail and the going gets much more difficult for Soneji. Alex Cross is a homicide detective with a doctorate in psychology. Most of the readers can relate to this main character because he's an average guy, who's down to earth. In this book he does have one obsession - he is attracted to a female supervisor of Washington's Secret Service. Cross is determined to stop Soneji before his madness can kill another person and must work around the conflicting emotions set in place by his affair with another in law enforcement. ALONG CAME A SPIDER is definitely a great. Patterson's first book, KISS THE GIRLS was awesome, but this one is even better than the last! The reader can easily relate to the easy going, down-to-earth character of Alex Cross, who plays the piano when he's troubled, or enjoys playing with his children. I think the normalcy of this character helps draw the reader into the story, until you can't put it down. Patterson's villains seem to be created from a nightmare too terrible to remember.

Having read the awesome book, I was expecting an excellent movie. But.... This movie was really bad. It was completely different than the book and was way too short. Oh, and by the way, for all of you people that are saying that this is the sequel to Kiss the Girls, it's NOT!!!! Along Came a Spider is the first and the sequel is Kiss The Girls!!!! The book was absolutely brilliant and kept you on the edge of your seat for the whole time. This movie strays far away from it and instead greatly reduces the story. The end comes way too abruptly while on the other hand, the book was a lot longer. The kidnapper, Gary Soneji, eludes the police numerous times in the book and does a lot more. On top of it, in the book, you never know if the killer has a split personality and it's not his fault because of his mental condition or if he's just evil and crazy. The movie isn't even that bad but it screwed over the movie. I think that the director of this movie only read the first 100 pages and then made a movie. A lot more happens! This movie is just way too short, and ruins an excellent book. My recommendation is to read the book and forget the movie. The book is excellent, thrilling and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Oh and by the way, Alex Cross was supposed to be a young detective not a 60 year old one! Morgan Freeman is great but that kind of ruins the books a little because there are a lot of books and this young detective meets many new foes. Forget any sequels after Kiss the Girls.</td><td>?????????</td><td>1121731200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-19</td><td>Tue </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>147</td><td>302</td></tr><tr><td>73508</td><td>4.0</td><td>22</td><td>false</td><td>A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Marc Ruby&amp;#8482;</td><td>I have to admit that I never quite understand why a director would decide to make a movie of a perfectly good suspense/mystery story (a best seller no less) and proceed to make wholesale modifications to the plot.  It almost guarantees that a good piece of the audience will dislike the film simply because it diverges from the book and never even notice that it is a good film all on its own. And it is a good film.  Morgan Freeman does a superb job of portraying Detective Alex Cross as he tries to peel away the layers of a kidnapping that gets away from everyone - kidnapper and police alike.  Gary Soneji(Michael Wincott), a teacher at a posh school for the children of the powerful, decides to improve his social standing by kidnapping Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), a senator's daughter.  He has everything worked out in detail, including getting Cross out of of semi-retirement, in order to demonstrate Soneji's brilliance. Joined by Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter). who was the secret service agent on duty when Soneji makes his move, Cross begins to sift through the details to try to understand Soneji enough to win Megan's Freedom.  With each fact comes more confusion and the plot will zigzag all over the event horizon before the final confrontation.  In many ways, this is a compelling combination of police procedural and suspense/psychotic film as the film switches back and forth between Cross and Soneji.  A lot of people get shot, but the film doesn't dwell on the gory parts. Mika Boorem does a fantastic job as the kidnapped girl, by the way.  She manages to find an unusual balance between fearful weakness and a surprising inner strength.  The film is well directed in a nicely understated way.  If it wasn't for the arbitrary changes to an already good plot Along Came A Spider would have been a real winner.  But even so, the basic surprises are carried over from the book to the film, the work is good, and the popcorn is warm.  If you like tricky detection tales, you'll find this film entirely satisfactory.</td><td>\"I am living proof, that a mind is a terrible thing\"</td><td>1121990400</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-07-22</td><td>Fri </td><td>Jul</td><td>102</td><td>53</td><td>148</td><td>365</td></tr><tr><td>73507</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3P3UOHYBFRGJN</td><td>0006476155</td><td>David A.

After his partner dies on a sting mission to catch a serial killer Cross retires unitl a senator's daughter is kidnapped and the kidnapper, Soneji, calls him, in order to make him famous as he copies the Lindbergh child kidnapping and tries to be imortalized for the crime of teh century.  After Cross looks at the details he is joined by Monica Potter, who is Jezzie, a secret service agent who was supposed to protect the little girl but failed.  After tracking the kidnapper and almost catching him twice and stopping him from his real mission, to kidnap the Russian presidents son, they finally get him. As Cross goes over the details inhis head he realizes someone has been on to him and is double crossing him, as he knows Soneji doesn't have the little girl anymore, so after Soneji nearly kills Jezzie, Cross kills him.  Thinking that he lost teh only lead to finding the little girl, Jezzie and the girl's parents are very angry with him.  But Cross hown his details to the Secret Service officers who are also onthe case and they see that one of there own was following Soneji for a long time and knew of this, and kidnapped the girl from Soneji and took a 10 million dollar ransom.  As Cross goes over more clues he sees the double crosser is now being double crossed by their partner and he rushes to a dramatic and surprising ending to save the little girl.

The movie wasn't all that bad, but it was lacking.  There is so much action in the book and I just don't understand why they didn't put more of that action into the movie.  If half of the action scenes from the book were included in the movie, I guaruntee I would have given it at least two more stars.  The worst part of the movie, in my opinion is when Alex Cross just so happens to guess the completely improbable password for Jezzie's computer.  Not only that, but she has a picture of her rental house and all its information on her computer.  Who does that?!  Since he got all the information about the house on Jezzie's computer, he goes to the house and saves the day.  That scene ruined the movie for me.  If you liked the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend reading it.

Even allowing for the extra description required to set up a character so that a series can be made out of him (i.e. Alex Cross), Patterson drags this story at best. I will admit that I read the first 250 or so pages VERY quickly, but all of a sudden the novel seemed to lose steam.  Combine this with the budding romance of Alex Cross that was focused on to the nth degree and did nothing to advance the plot and it made for a very difficult novel to complete. I made myself finish the novel because I was eager to get on to other Alex Cross novels that I knew received rave reviews.  I too do not like to read a series out of order so I forced myself through the remaining pages.  However, I found myself questioning whether or not ANY of the other Alex Cross books would be worth reading (they are, don't worry) during the course of this book. One last bit before I conclude, I was INCREDIBLY disturbed by the final chapters of this novel and I do not feel much of the description was necessary to get Patterson's view across. With all this being said, please do not use Spider as a judge for the other books in the Alex Cross series.  I have not come upon these issues again in any of the other Cross novels I have completed.  But, suffice it to say that it took a little while for Patterson to find a rhythm for his most famous leading man.</td><td>I know I'm probably alone here...</td><td>1127347200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2005-09-22</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>154</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>73501</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AWPN0LDV9K9BR</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Bill Marks</td><td>Starting the first Alex Cross novel was one of the best books i have ever read.

In one review someone said the romance with Alex Cross didn't really contribute to anything and i will agree because there really was no use for the relationship considering the only real relationship they had was sex and mind games (towards the end). But this book has the greatest twists and turns in almost any novel i have ever read that you can esily over look the dumb romance. I want to tell everyone the mega twist but i urge you to find out for yourselves. I will go ahead and say it concerns an unthinkable betrayel and you find out at the end of chapter 75.

He saved the day in that movie. Plus, I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up. Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A Spider.</td><td>MUCH better than Kiss The Girls...</td><td>1138579200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2006-01-30</td><td>Mon </td><td>Jan</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>160</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>73495</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>A1YWUHRJDMATPI</td><td>0006476155</td><td>P. Robinson</td><td>This is the only Alex Cross book that gets 5 stars. I love Alex Cross, but most of the series only get 3 or 4, and everything after \"Violets are Blue\" gets only 1 star. Here is why:  Patterson had a very strong creation in Alex Cross. He was an interesting character with flaws and emotions. Also, he wasn't a \"tough-guy\" hero; he was a man who used his mind to solve crimes. He is a psychologist, not a rogue cop that makes up his own rules.  Also, in this book he is pitted against a very unique and clever villain - Gary Soneji - a madman who kidnaps a young girl from a private school who has a very powerful father. This book has a great plot and moves at a breakneck speed. There is little time for description or introspection on the part of the characters, and that is what makes this book great. There are countless twists and turns, and the reader is constantly guessing. Now, that being said, it is Patterson's style of writing that makes this book amazing, and the rest of them derivative pulp.  Patterson insists on having over 100 chapters in each of his books. This is not to say they are long books, rather each chapter is merely 2-3 pages long. This in itself is not the problem. The problem is that each chapter starts halfway down the page [leaving half a page of white space] and the chapter will end at the beginning of a new page, only a few lines down [leaving another half page of white space].  I have heard many readers say that they love Patterson, because they read his books so quickly. Well, the fact is that the buyer is paying for about 35 percent white space in any given Patterson book - which is only about 300 pages long in the first place! Now, again, I am not saying this is bad. It is a technique that gives the feeling of incredible suspense as one is literally turning the pages faster than can be imagined when reading a book of substance. However, after the first book in this series I was tired of this device, and I can finish an Alex Cross book in just over an hour.  I may as well have been watching television!  Anyhow, this first book is worth reading, however, please be skeptical of anyone who thinks they are literati because they can devour a whole Patterson book in one sitting.  Buy this book, but make sure that you buy the rest of this series from a used book store so Patterson is not rewarded for his 120 pages of white space per novel.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and would recommend it on the basis that it's an interesting, undemanding read: perhaps one to go for if you've just spent days ploughing through something a little more 'literary', which this sure isn't!!</td><td>My faith in Patterson is restored</td><td>1170892800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2007-02-08</td><td>Thu </td><td>Feb</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>174</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>73475</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AH7EWQ7HHVBH0</td><td>0006476155</td><td>ZoSo</td><td>This is, simply, a very entertaining book.

Effective disguises and role-playing over long periods of time, plus the ability to wait for years to execute a crime plan, is what makes Gary Murphy/Soneji so frightening. I had read Kiss the Girls earlier, with no background on Alex Cross.  Reread it and found that what I remembered were the characters Kate and Scootchie.  I had totally forgotten who did the crimes...in Kiss the Girls this is revealed at the very end...we're surprised but also disappointed since we don't know this guy as a human being at all, only as Casanova.  Casanova and the Gentleman Caller are not portrayed with anything like the depth of Patterson's Gary character. Also Patterson handles the surprise ending much better in Spider.  Jezzie's name should tip us off (Jezebel?), as well as the fact that her relationship with Alex is just too too magazine-story perfect.  But the gradual revelation of what happened to Maggie Rose - as well as how and why - is well done and seeing her reunited with her mother is very satisfying. I enjoy Alex and his family, his midnight porch piano-playing, etc., as well as Man Mountain Sampson, Nana Mama and the kids.  At the end of Kiss the Girls, it is clear that Soneji will be coming around again (shades of The Poet, by Michael Connelly).  Yeah, it's different to know who the criminal is, early on...maddening to watch him dance away...but hey, that's what being hooked on this stuff is all about!</td><td>Things (and people) are not always what they seem...</td><td>1177372800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2007-04-24</td><td>Tue </td><td>Apr</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>176</td><td>275</td></tr><tr><td>73473</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A26MX1ZPYF20KV</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Roogirl06</td><td>This was the second book i had read of JP's.

It is not clear why the emphasis on race was downplayed as the series progressed. Once again, we see the super-crafty criminal, a murderer and kidnapper.  Such figures dominate thrillers, whereas in real life, the criminals tend to be below normal in intelligence and make mistake after mistake.  Perhaps mediocre to stupid just isn't interesting enough.  If I have a fault with the plot, it is the villain's talent and the attempt to cram too much of this into too few pages.  Jeopardy, of course, is what fuels the story, but too much is still too much. The detailed, R-rated inter-racial love interest is distracting from the plot.  It does figure in the finale, but it might have been done better.  It just seemed manipulative, put into the book for the prurient reader.

At a high-security private school, math teacher Gary Soneji kidnapped two students - Michael Goldberg, whose father is the Secretary of the Treasury, and Maggie Rose Dunne, the daughter of a famous actress. Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist who works as a DC homicide detective. After being pulled off a serial killer case in one of DC's lower-income neighborhoods, Alex is thrown into the hunt for Michael and Maggie Rose, as well as apprehending Gary Soneji. Michael soon turns up dead, and Gary Soneji is arrested in a McDonalds far from the capital city. There's just one problem. Gary Soneji is known to the world as Gary Murphy, a quiet man who works hard to provide for his family. This is not the image that the kidnapper, who calls himself the \"Son of Lindbergh\", has given himself. Does he suffer from multiple personality disorder? Or is he just putting on an act for the police? And what has happened to Maggie Rose? During the next two years, Alex Cross develops a relationship with Gary. But when things start to look strange, he begins to ask questions that reach far into the government. Who is Gary Murphy/Soneji? And how exactly does Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan fit into the puzzle? \"Along Came a Spider\" is James Patterson's first Alex Cross novel, and it is truly a page-turning thriller. With a vividly-described and likable protagonist and a mystery with more turns than a maze, Patterson has created a world that will stay with you long after the final secret is revealed.</td><td>What Happened to Maggie Rose?</td><td>1206662400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2008-03-28</td><td>Fri </td><td>Mar</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>184</td><td>263</td></tr><tr><td>73465</td><td>4.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</td><td>0006476155</td><td>R.

Next, there's a kidnapping at a DC school for VIP Children. Emily Rose (the daughter of Senator Rose) is kidnapped by her teacher. Mika Boorem plays young Emily and this kid is not your average hostage.  She's a bright young girl and she fights back. Alex Cross is still recovering in his home when the kidnapper calls him and involves him in the case.  It seems the man wants to become as famous Lindbergh kidnapper.  Dr. Cross is along to 'document the case.' Cross is joined by Jezzie Flannigan (Potter) the Secret Service agent at the school who failed to see the kidnapper as a threat. \"Along Came a Spider\" is a fast-paced thriller with the added value of a child hostage and two police who are trying to prove themselves after failures.  If I could ask James Patterson one question, it would be who he had in mind for Dr. Alex Cross when he wrote the novels.

And it works not because of the kidnapping of the child. Not because of the pathos that comes along with such a case all the time, every time. Not because of the failed attempt of the girl to escape. Not because of the child's father's over-reacting. It works because the plot is too simple to be accepted like that. A solitary man could not have planned and realized that plot in Washington DC, with the Russian security services looking after the son of the Ambassador and the secret service working there full time in that private school. Too much security in that school for such a kidnapping to have been done by only one person. Then there must have been accomplices and that's how the film works because we do not know who he or she or they is or are and we are looking out for the clues, for the punch line, for the final and supreme plotter. And that's just what it is all about, one plotter double-crossing the other or the others, or even maybe three tiers instead of just two, and maybe even four tiers, and we are double-crossed in a magnificent way just the very same way the profiling cop is double-crossed in a very standard way. The profiler is profiled by the criminal and then side-tracked because when you know the profile of the profiler the profiler becomes predictable and then inefficient, impotent. So that helps to take the medicine down indeed, even if the girl survives only because the criminals did not do one thing right, only one thing, one single and unique thing. It only takes one mistake for the best adventures to fail. Just find out which thing and who.

First of all, let me begin by saying that I'm a big advocate of reading series' from beginning to end, without skipping books along the way.  Because of that, and because I can unequivically tell you that the Cross books only get better, I'm giving Along Came a Spider 3 stars and recommending that it be read. With that in mind, this book was SLOW.  I understand that Patterson was working to set up the lives of characters who would be carried over for later novels in the series, but the overall action in this book was a drag.  Heck, even the timeline of the story spans more than two years! I greatly respect James Patterson.  He's one of my favorite authors and I will be the first to tell anyone that the novels in the Alex Cross series typically make for really great reads.  But, I've got to be honest with you regarding the first one - The engine definitely took a while to leave the station for this series starter.</td><td>Mediocre start to a great series...</td><td>1226620800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2008-11-14</td><td>Fri </td><td>Nov</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>191</td><td>216</td></tr><tr><td>73458</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3Q33XPEYEZJ5W</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Reads Thrillers</td><td>The actions and inter-actions of the authorities were not realistic as the Secret Service is responsible for protecting not for investigations.

Most of the book deals with the examination of the kidnapper/murderer and that is easily the best part of the book.

I don't know what took me so long to discover why he's such a popular author but I'm glad I finally did. Although I must add that once I started reading him I was on a hunt for the rest of the books I was missing, it's impossible not to get engrossed and lost in a slick thriller such as \"Along Came a Spider\" and not crave more. The moment I was done with the 1st book I was all ready dreaming of snatching the 2nd, it was worth to wake up early on Sunday and make a quick run to the bookstore for the next chapter of Alex Cross's life. I usually don't read a series back to back but my mind and appetite were taken hostage and I had to succumb to the calling of another great book. Let me just say how easy it is to have this or his other books spoiled, I didn't read the editorial reviews till after I was done with the story and good thing too, I felt that some of the surprising moments were being dangerously close to being mentioned. This highly suspenseful story begins with a kidnapping from the past that inspires future psychopaths; the famous Lindenberg baby is snatched from his crib, to be buried alive. This becomes the inspiration for Gary Murphy and the evolution of his alter ego Gary Soneji - ruthless kidnapper and killer with over two hundred victims on his black soul. Gary wants to be somebody, he wants the streets to hum and buzz with terror at the very thought of his name, he's also an exceptional planner who's ideas take years to plan and without leaving any prints or traces of his true identity. He's the master of disguises and faux credentials that let him slip into many sectors unnoticed, and watch his future victims. Gary decides to act on his master plan and kidnap two prominent children from their highly guarded school. The ransom is in millions but sometimes Gary likes the mental and physical torture more than money, he lives and breathes on inflicting terror on men, women and anything that will cross his way, especially children. He's trilled at the thought that the famous Alex Cross is on his tail, and he does his best to taunt and stalk the man, leaving him more crimes to solve. Just when things start to come to light another devious plot exudes a foul stench, a warning that the case if far from being over, one that puts a real spin on the story. I cannot say any more, this book is best read with knowing the smallest bit of detail because so much happens and not all turns out well for Cross. For a five hundred page book this reads extremely fast, I was done with it in two days and if my eye balls weren't revolting I would have read something right after it but they needed a break. It's quite enjoyable to read a juicy book that doesn't let go and one that ends with a bang, now I see why so many people read and like Patterson, he's pretty awesome. - Kasia S.</td><td>Beware of the sticky web of deceit</td><td>1240185600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-04-20</td><td>Mon </td><td>Apr</td><td>40</td><td>27</td><td>201</td><td>562</td></tr><tr><td>73431</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A8YDXMFXJ4R6X</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Amber</td><td>Good movie to watch, but not really all that engaging.

Comparing Along Came a Spider to A Farewell To Arms is like comparing a Mozart symphony to current pop music. That said, you will find a pretty good crime thriller that you can run through in a couple days. That's the reason the work is a massive bestseller. I thought the plot was compelling but, even at 500+ pages, I didn't really feel that much for the victims. Patterson devotes much more development time to the \"bad guys\". Also, superfluous writing crops up every now and then. For example, I remember one part where a criminal says something along the lines of: \"Believe whatever the hell you want.\" Then after that quote, we get this profound commentary from the narrator: \"He didn't care what I thought.\" Well, obviously! Not a major problem, but it comes across as a little amateur. Still, even after those criticisms, I did mostly enjoy the book. If you're looking for a quick, easy read with some interesting twists, I say go for it.

Actor Morgan Freeman does best in films where he's the likable hero-cop. He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many \"oh, come on's\" said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible. For a tough modern-day crime story this film, for the most part, was pretty low- key with low profanity and not a lot of gore or overdone action. That was surprising considering the sordid subject matter. The tameness in here, and the quality of Freeman's acting, make this a small notch above the average thriller.</td><td>Slightly Above Average</td><td>1247097600</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-07-09</td><td>Thu </td><td>Jul</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>206</td><td>151</td></tr><tr><td>73426</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3LJSF0LV5QRYT</td><td>0006476155</td><td>woodrow locksley</td><td>I have a brother who is really interestedin crime fiction and he has spoken highly of this series so I read the books not in order however. this is where you should start.the murderer is an intersting villain but it is the characterization of Cross his hrandmother and his best friend John Sampson that maid this book compelling and led me to read the rest of the series even though it shows the signs of a beginner in being overwritten at times despite the short chapters</td><td>decent first novel in series</td><td>1249603200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2009-08-07</td><td>Fri </td><td>Aug</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>207</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>73422</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AN05NDW56HNMH</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Melanie Zamarripa</td><td>James Patterson is one of my favorite writers.

Edmund</td><td>Along Came a Spider is probably the epitome of what every crime-thriller novel should be. At 500 pages its easy to devour reading, the suspense is well balanced, but the real key to success is Alex Cross himself. Alex is a black, detective with a degree in psychology, who is passionate about his work, volunteers at a food bank and counsels on the side. And he isn't perfect, he loses his head and punches out racists, doesn't spend enough time at home with his kids and is a bit of a sucker for the ladies. The plot of the novel is pretty basic, but flows well, the first half reads like a standard serial killer case, the pace does slow a little in the second half as deeper intrigue is revealed. As a psychology major I like Alex's brief discussions about psyc, although I find his use of hypnotism dubious (but hey this was the early ninties not 2010) The love scenes are a little clumsy, particularly a steamy bath scene which kinda failed to interest. Most surprising was the ending (I'll try not to spoil anything) where one of the crooks gets their punishment. I found it oddly touching and poignant.

This is my first James Patterson novel and boy what a novel this is. How many twists and turns you can keep in a novel.

I had seen this movie but I don't think I had ever read the book. The case was compelling and the twist (even though I knew it was coming) still kind of caught me off guard. James Patterson truly has a way of sucking you into a story and never quite knowing which way he is going to turn. What I Liked: The pacing was a little off in this book but with that in mind I liked how each new element of the book was introduced. I also like how no storyline was dropped and forgotten. It was interesting to read the physical characteristics of the characters because they were a little off from what I thought they would look like so I had to adjust my mental images of the main characters. Complaints: None Movie Comparison Thoughts: Physically I don't think any of the casting matched the actual characters in the book---that being said I think everyone did a great job in their roles. I know these are older movies but as thrillers I think they have stood the test of time. Why I gave it a 4: I didn't like it as much as Kiss the Girls (I seldom like book 1 in a series as much as the rest of the series) but it was still a really good read. Who would I recommend it too: Thriller/Mystery fans.

The suspense is there when needed, and the twists come and go with intended impact and yet, when all is said and done I can't seem to really care to see the film again.  I think maybe that has to do with the fact that, while it does everything with fine effect, it doesn't do anything `special'.  `Along Came a Spider' is a decent crime-thriller that sports a fine performance from Morgan Freeman (who could very easily have phoned this in and yet he surprisingly doesn't) and a clever twist here and there, but that is all.  I much preferred the films predecessor, which is actually a sequel to this film (`Kiss the Girls') which, while certainly teetering on the generic in certain respects, contained a savagely sincere performance from Ashley Judd that elevated the film immensely.  `Along Came a Spider' doesn't equal that intensity.

I've never been an enormous fan of James Patterson's style and the way he chooses to flesh out the skeletons of his plotlines. But the plotlines themselves are the best and most intricate in the business.  This book in particular, along with Kiss the Girls, provides some of the most well-developed and complex storyline labyrinths in the murder / detective genre. Patterson always seems to have a way to detract from his own incredible plots with some cheesy writing, and continually brings his books from five stars to four in this manner...  But four stars is nothing to sneeze at. Another fast-paced and compelling read from the pen of James Patterson.</td><td>Writing Style is occasionally ho-hum but Patterson is the Master of Plot</td><td>1325980800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2012-01-08</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jan</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>237</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>73379</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AE5TIR7VRQAYD</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Leslie</td><td>While on medical leave from work I sat down to read one of Patterson's books and ended up reading the entire Alex Cross & Women's Murder Club series in 2 weeks!!

The plot, the events, and actions were very well done.  I was surprised and pleased.  The book definitely kept my interest.  The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't smile.  I think of Grisham who takes me to the 5 star level.  He writes a similar genre, but he makes me smile, either at the intriguing characters, or the \"wow that is so exciting\" when being chased or trapped or wondering if the hero will survive. At times I felt impatient to get some answers.  The result was it felt a little slow.  I've read other police procedural mysteries that had me less impatient and enjoying the journey more. The narrator Charles Turner was fine, but I wish Morgan Freeman had narrated.  The character Alex Cross is a black man from the south.  Morgan played Alex in the movie, and I kept thinking about him.  He would have been a great narrator. The story is told in first person from Alex's point of view and then third person for other characters and events.  That structure worked ok, but I would have preferred third person for all.  When he switches to first person, I am almost taken out of the story, thinking of myself - my perspective. DATA: Unabridged audiobook reading time: 12 hrs and 21 mins.  Violence: strong.

He finds himself being forced into a kidnapping case when the kidnapper plants evidence in Alex's mailbox that makes him look like the kidnapper. The teacher, Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), works at an elite school for the privileged children of many international figures and the heads of countries.  He has plans that involve multiple kidnappings and the Secret Service and the child's parents wants Alex to help solve the case...... This movie is a thriller and a well thought through storyline that will hold your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat.  It features an excellent cast and the acting in this film is very good.  The story is based on the book written by James Patterson.  The story line has changed but it contains multiple twists and plot changes that will keep you guessing who are the bad guys and who are the good guys.

The gook can be read as a standalone book or you can continue on in the series. I'm looking forward to the series. What kept the book from being great is that the romance portion was rather predictable and somewhat unbelievable given the personality of the main character. I think developing romantic relationships in suspense books is very tricky and needs to be done lightly and not rushed - most authors don't do this aspect very well. I also anticipated how the book would end and who was involved and it would have been nice to be completely shocked by the ending.</td><td>Good, But Not Great</td><td>1350172800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2012-10-14</td><td>Sun </td><td>Oct</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>262</td><td>149</td></tr><tr><td>73351</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A3E2U21OE35O73</td><td>0006476155</td><td>loves to read</td><td>Great condition for a book that is over 10 years old.

Kirk</td><td>Alex Cross is an articulate, educated black man who is a homicide detective Washington D.C. police department. He just needs to be in a better novel. In this debut novel that features said character, Cross is put on a case to find two, white, wealthy kids abducted from a private school. This bothers him somewhat as he was on a case where two black children are missing, and yet no law officials seem interested. The villain of the piece is Gary Soneji, who masqueraded as an instructor of the private school; he is your typical psycho who is also brilliant and wants to be remembered throughout history. (These types of villains showed up a lot in the films of the 1990s). Cross meets a beautiful, blonde, white FBI agent named Jezzie whom he has a relationship with, and gets serious with...only that he finds out that she (in a confusing plot turn) had something to do with the two abducted white children. She was only faking a relationship with Cross to get police information from him; Jezzie and two other officers (also in a confusing plot turn) somehow took charge of the abducting operation of the private school children. Cross, in an unrealistic manner, catches Jezzie by going back to an island they traveled to early in the novel, having people placed strategically in places as if he had clairvoyance that Jezzie would 1. Come back with him to the island. 2. They would travel the exact way where his people would be waiting. 3. Jezzie would say exactly what he needed to know in order to have evidence to arrest her, and her cohorts. Interestingly, Jezzie is the one who is given the death penalty, and Soneji is not....(only hinting from his cell that he will be back). Moreover, it is said that Soneji had something to do with the missing black kids as well! Now, as aforementioned, I am familiar with the film adaptation of this novel; and, that wasn't an improvement. It was actually worse. Both the film and the novel it was based on is confusing, convoluted, and generic or cliched...not too mention unrealistic with how certain things automatically fall into place, or how the main character has - as aforementioned - plot clairvoyance. I do plan on reading the next entry, `Kiss the Girls,' and I hope there is an improvement.</td><td>Meh...*possible spoilers*</td><td>1363651200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-03-19</td><td>Tue </td><td>Mar</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>340</td><td>396</td></tr><tr><td>73226</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A18MDZG4YLD5DE</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Aleta M Allison</td><td>As always very good book by James Patterson.

Huston</td><td>\"Along Came A Spider\" is an okay installment to the Alex Cross series in my eyes.  I think that it is overrated, but I do think that it is okay for being the first. The writing is good and the characters are interesting.  Patterson does a great job introducing the main character, Alex Cross himself, in a fitting way.  But the best parts are when we see him with his family.  And his kids are so adorable.  Janelle and Damon make me want to see them more.  Including Nana Mama, who I just love seeing getting into arguments with Alex.  Other characters like John, Jezzie, and Soneji I actually like.  The mystery is done well too. But this novel has its problems.  The romance between Alex and Jezzie feels a little forced (despite that there is some development).  The final twist at the end really makes me angry.  I won't give anything major away, but it deals with Jezzie and I really hate what Patterson did to her.  I love Jezzie as a character.  It didn't sit well with me.  Even the time jumps feel out of place.  They don't go back and forth or anything, they just skip a couple of weeks or months, which made the pacing of the novel itself feel a little to slow.  Soneji's character didn't get the attention that I was hoping for in the end.  In fact, the ending itself felt a little to depressing. In the end, despite its problems I might have with it, this novel works out fine and it makes me excited for Alex's next adventure.  I say it is worth reading and buying.</td><td>A nice way to kick off the series.</td><td>1368748800</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-05-17</td><td>Fri </td><td>May</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>416</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>73146</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1Z67F06QEGKNA</td><td>0006476155</td><td>RG Bud Phelps</td><td>I had read the book but that didn't take away any of the excitement of the movie.

The man, Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), has been working as a teacher of computer science at the school and the girl, Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), is the daughter of a U.S. Senator Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty). Megan has a close relationship with another pupil at the school, Dmitri Starodubov (Anton Yelchin), son of the Russian President. Megan and Dmitri, both gifted children, have worked out a computer code for communicating with each other class and sending secret messages between them when they are supposed to be working. Secret Service agent Jazzie Flanigan (Monica Potter) is held responsible for the kidnapping as her specific assignment was to protect Megan. Soneji seems to be intent upon mirroring the famous 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh's infant son. But it seems that Soneji is also intent upon kidnapping Dmitri, but is foiled by Cross. Cross pays a ransom for release of the girl but when the two confront each other, Soneji claims to know nothing of the ransom. I won't disclose the outcome. This is an ingenious and gripping plot with several twists and turns and very well acted by all the principals.</td><td>A gripping and well-acted thriller</td><td>1370131200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-06-02</td><td>Sun </td><td>Jun</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>426</td><td>215</td></tr><tr><td>73118</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A25N2REUZ42BP</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Luther</td><td>an interesting plot; not predictable.

Osier</td><td>Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist as well as a Washington, D.C. police detective. He's also a black man whose wife was murdered several years ago, leaving him with two small children to rear - thankfully not alone. His grandmother, a formidable retired educator whom Alex calls Nana Mama because after his mother's early death he knew no other parent, lives with the family and takes care of the children. When two nasty murder cases involving black families come his way, Alex wants to catch the killer even more passionately than usual. But before he really gets the investigation underway, two white children are kidnapped from an exclusive private school when they were supposed to be under Secret Service protection. Thanks to the unwanted fame brought to him by a recent news article, the mayor orders Cross pulled off the murder cases and assigned to the kidnapping. Cross is his best, the public surely believes, and the mayor must be seen giving this case his best. For its victims are the young daughter of a film star, and the young son of the Secretary of the Treasury. Cross doesn't want to investigate a kidnapping for ransom whose victims need him a lot less, in his opinion, than the black families who will likely become the deranged killer's next targets. His resistance gets him nowhere with the mayor. But as he works on the kidnapping, however unwillingly, he comes to know the Secret Service supervisory agent on whose watch it happened; and before he knows it, widower Alex Cross is falling in love with a most unsuitable partner. A beautiful white woman in the same dangerous business. The cases he wants to investigate can't possibly be connected with the kidnapping that he thinks someone else can and should handle. Or can they? The more he learns, the less he feels that he really knows. Has the brilliant Alex Cross finally met his match, in a criminal even more intelligent and driven than he is? This is a scary book indeed, and not due to excessive gore. It's got some of that, yes; but the worst of its terrors are psychological, as Cross pursues a psychopath. I'm told this is the first book in a series, and after it kept me awake until the wee hours of this morning I find myself eager to get my hands on the next installment.

Later in the book it refers back to this (from the killer's perspective/POV) and he is looking back on it SIXTY years ago. Simple math (apparently not done by the editors, writer, or any praiseworthy readers) puts our serial killer at 72 years old. And this 72 year old man bests kids at video games and kills an FBI agent with a knife in hand combat? -Get real. 2- Yeah, we get it, Alex Cross is black. Does it really need to be mentioned on every single page? Was race the major motivator in this story? Seems like it was more of a focus than plot. Does it really matter what race he is? 3- No matter how good Alex Cross might be at his job, a detective mouthing off to the police chief and the *Mayor* keeps his job and is allowed to say things like F__ you to his superiors? Unrealistic!

I LOVE Morgan Freeman. He's one of my all-time favorite actors, but he had no business playing Alex Cross. Alex Cross is supposed to be this young, sexy beefcake cop who happens to have a doctorate in psychology. They should have gotten Will Smith or Denzel Washington at the least to play this part. While I adore Mr. Freeman and his acting, he's most assuredly not in the \"beefcake\" category. Not by a longshot. The rest of the acting is so-so. As a mystery the plot is lukewarm at best, and the whole movie just lacked that \"certain something\" that made it in any way suspenseful.

The story opens with a prologue regarding the infamous kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby in 1932, as explained through the thoughts of the 12-year old kidnapper.  It then jumps to 1992, and introduces Alex Cross, who is a brilliant Homicide detective and psychologist, his partner, John Sampson, and his delightful grandmother, Nana Mama.  As the story unfolds, Alex and his partner are called to a triple homicide scene where a mother, daughter, and 3-year old boy have been brutally murdered; a similar murder has just previously occurred, and Cross suspects this is just the beginning of a rash of serial murders in the poorest part of town targeting blacks.  Cross is determined to solve the murders, even though those in management at the police department regard these murders as unimportant because they involve the poor.  While at the murder scene, Cross is called to a private school where a famous actress' daughter and the son of the Secretary of the Treasury have been kidnapped by a man posing as a teacher at the school, Gary Soneji.  Cross is told that the kidnappings are high-priority, and he resents the fact that two rich kids take precedence over six murders of innocent, albeit poor, black victims.  Patterson does an excellent job of merging the two scenarios as Cross investigates and works to solve both of the crimes. For those unfamiliar with the Alex Cross series, this book is the one to read first; it explains the background of the characters while weaving them through a very suspenseful tale with many unexpected twists and turns.  Patterson makes the characters seem believable and real; readers will be kept on the edge of their seats, and will admit that the only drawback of the novel is that it ends.  Most suspense/thriller aficionados will waste no time picking up the next book in the series. This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.</td><td>Along Came a Spider</td><td>1377734400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-08-29</td><td>Thu </td><td>Aug</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>476</td><td>364</td></tr><tr><td>72997</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>AU0ZV3WDS6JGS</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Rita</td><td>Our family really enjoyed this \"older movie\" - James Patterson's work is truely untimeless!  yet another great work for all to enjoy!</td><td>Morgan Freeman - Great as always</td><td>1377907200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-08-31</td><td>Sat </td><td>Aug</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>477</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>72996</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A1WFE2C8TJ6WON</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Katherine Jones</td><td>This book has many twists and turns, it kept me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who did it.

This book is targeted for the thriller/suspense genre. it takes place in Washington, D.C. This book is about two kids from two wealthy families who get kidnapped by a man who poses as their teacher. The whole novel is about a whole team of people who are working hard to find the kids. Patterson switches points of view every few chapters so that the reader can see the story unravel from other perspectives, not just the main character's. I personally loved the book. I feel that the author kept enough details hidden to the point that the reader would be mind blown when they were revealed. Many people don't really like the writing style that James Patterson uses in his books, but I personally do. I have to admit, I have read many other James Patterson books, and I have loved them all. The only problem I have with this particular book is where he talks about how one of the character's wives died. In other books in this series (I am ashamed to admit that I read this series out of order before discovering my mistake) he gives a different account on how she died.</td><td>Along Came A Spider by James Patterson</td><td>1378339200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-05</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>483</td><td>207</td></tr><tr><td>72986</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3BKGW9HSU2B9G</td><td>0006476155</td><td>T-Weeder Tool</td><td>Great movie.

Patterson got famous for his plotting skills, and his mastery of this element shows in this work.  The pacing is fast, the tension is constantly high, and the surprises keep on coming. 2) Characters (4 stars) - Alex Cross is not just a Dirty Harry, he is also thoughtful and sensitive and perceptive.  Gary Soneji is not just a raving psychopath, he is also a calculating enigma.  Jezzie is not just a simple love interest, she also has a mystery of her own.  All these characters could have been one-dimensional and the story would still have worked.  But they weren't, and for me that really elevated this book above the ranks of the traditional thriller. 3) Theme (2 stars) - This book is so much about the charging plot of trying to solve a kidnapping mystery that messages or morals really take a back seat.  There did seem to be one, though, about how the lust for fame will make people do crazy things, as personified by the villain, but this theme wasn't explored much deeper than the surface level. 4) Voice (4 stars) - Yes, Patterson is an easy read.  But (at least in this work) I didn't find that skill of easiness to come with the usual trappings of 8th grade diction and clich.  His sentences reflect the POV of the chapter lead, and they do a great job conveying the mood and characters' psyche while also telling a fast paced tale. 5) Setting (4 stars) - Washington DC is the locus of events, but the action seeps out up and down the Eastern Seaboard.  Patterson does a good job describing each scene in just enough detail to transport you there, but not too much to slow the ride. 6) Overall (4 stars) - The main reason you read a Patterson novel is the plot, and that element doesn't disappoint here.  But I was also pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and the prose.  I'd recommend it.</td><td>Plot - 5, Characters - 4, Theme - 2, Voice - 4, Setting - 4, Overall - 4</td><td>1378944000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-12</td><td>Thu </td><td>Sep</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>486</td><td>385</td></tr><tr><td>72980</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ALGQI8XRHWTKP</td><td>0006476155</td><td>James Sharrar</td><td>Taut.

I recommend reading this first if you are embarking on reading the Alex Cross series.  Mr. Patterson does a good job of making each book stand on it's own, but Alex is more raw and real in the first one than in some of the later books.  This is also one of the better books of the series.  If you haven't read Patterson before he has a style of short chapters, straightforward sentences and a fairly linear train of thought through the book.  This makes for quick reading and easy reading  which is helpful if you only get to read in short bursts between other activities.</td><td>Good First of Series</td><td>1379203200</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-09-15</td><td>Sun </td><td>Sep</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>488</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>72968</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>A39DIW9IN23IH8</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Valerie, Ohio</td><td>I bought every book in this series because after I read the first one, I just waned more!

This series is a murder mystery/ cop drama kind of series and is definitly at the top of it's genre.  It is not for the younger audience or the very tender hearted as it has graphic literary imagery.  It puts you in the mind set of TV shows like Rizoli and Isles, Law and Order, CSI, and Major Crimes in the sense of type of series and graphic crimes but its focus on one detective, his cases, his life and his family makes it a more personal look at the crime and solving of it.

We bought it because we have faith in Morgan Freeman's talent and he didn't let us down. The edge-of-your-seat suspense is there from the very first frame and never lets up.

You can't put it down until you get it over with. I completed this book in a day maybe. I'm a big fan of Psychological thrillers and this is my best book so far.

He's a fine actor and he does his usual good job here. The problem is the seriously stoopid plot.  And the seriously obvious bad guy not five minutes into the film. (OK, maybe 10.) Simply put, while Secret Service operatives assigned to protect important people may have their flaws, greed isn't credibly one of them; the work doesn't attract people who are in it for the money. Finally, while I usually dislike TV and films where children are threatened, the victim here is spectacular: smart and resourceful. I actually enjoyed watching her foil her kidnappers.  Advice?

I've continued to purchase them as they are released and my wife has read them all, so I decided that the best thing to do was to start over from the beginning. This was actually the second Alex Cross (and James Patterson) book that I read. For some reason, I read Kiss the Girls shortly after it's release. I distinctly remembered that Along Came a Spider had a very different feel from Kiss the Girls and most of Patterson's later works. Turns out, I remembered correctly. Along Came a Spider still has a lot of the Patterson feel to it, but it seems to move at a bit slower pace than his subsequent novels. Don't get me wrong there is still plenty of action and lots of plot twists, it just seems that Patterson let's things take a little more time to develop. Overall, I thought that it was a really good book. Patterson's works will never be mistaken for high-brow literature, but they are fun to read and you never quite know where he's going to take you. This novel does a great job of introducing Alex Cross & Co. and the villain is one of his best.</td><td>My Review</td><td>1385942400</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2013-12-02</td><td>Mon </td><td>Dec</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>518</td><td>212</td></tr><tr><td>72910</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A16SNT32UNOG90</td><td>0006476155</td><td>C David Brown</td><td>Morgan Freeman has yet to take on a dull or dead role.

However, the movie simply deviates too much from its source material to truly merit the description of \"adaptation\".  While the plot of the movie was good and its cast was superb (isn't Morgan Freeman always?), this film might have done better in my eyes had it not been adapted from the novel of the same name to begin with.  Ultimately, they don't share much apart from the character names and a few plot details.  I do understand that a movie must take certain liberties with its source material, especially a novel, as there are time constraints.  But so much that made this novel great was cut out and, in many cases, replaced by plot devices which probably did not take up more or less time than the original.  Perhaps this was a book that would have been best served by a movie split into two parts (i.e. like the 7th Harry Potter book.)  As a general crime thriller, I say it's far above average mostly thanks to its casting choices, but I feel so much more could have been done with it even if it weren't an adaptation.  As for my recommendation, I do recommend it to anyone who's a fan of crime thrillers with a decent plot and a great cast.  For all the James Patterson/Alex Cross fans out there, I'll leave it up to you.

ALONG CAME A SPIDER is a gem.  It is a world class highly sophisticated thriller for the ages.  It is a heart stopping thrill ride of the imagination, a ride into darkness so deep you won't know which direction is up. The emotions of the reader are guaranteed to run high when two celebrity children are kidnapped, and when it turns out they are held by a mass murdering psychopath, your eyes and your hands are guaranteed to be glued to your kindle for the duration of the read. We are introduced to the legendary and brilliant Washington Detective, Alex Cross.  His wife was killed in a drive-by shooting three years ago but he is still grieving.  His partner, John Sampson, is a life long friend.  Cross and his two children are living with his grandmother who still volunteers at the local primary school.  Cross the man has an incredible career - and amazing potential -  ahead of him and given his background, he is understandably happy to stay (in Washington) where he feels he can achieve the most for the common good.  But there are people above him who can see his talents and intelligence (he has a PhD in Psychology) and are consequently pushing him toward higher things.  So there is tension on several levels in this fine, fine tome. The kidnapper is a lunatic. Seriously.  Mr Gary Soneji is a mass murdering delusionist who kills for the fun and self imposed glory of it all. After slashing the throat of a high powered member of the FBI, the reader finds him crying out for a challenge in his life.  Well, guess what buddy!  Alex Cross is about to give you a challenge you will never forget! We also meet 24 year old blonde bombshell and secret service agent, Jezzie Flanagan, who comes to work everyday on a high powered black BMW sports motorbike.  She too is a highly qualified cast member of the story and those in the know recognise her for what she is.  A player. And so to the writing.  It is beautifully balanced, with excellent building of suspense and tension as you progress through the story.  The characters are fantastically created and each have their own set of histories.  The book itself has longer and deeper chapters than the newer releases from the world famous writer and the book feels more solid as a result.  The language is strong - another difference from the newer books but given the setting of the characters and their histories, I guess the reader can overlook this.  The book is violent.  It certainly is not funny.  That would be totally ridiculous.  There are moments of poignancy and emotion scattered like grains of chalk across an empty blackboard.  It has an excellent feel and will make the reader deeply, deeply satisfied at the end. And so to the ending.  It is quite extraordinary.  It is multi-directional with twists and turns. And chops and changes.  You won't know where to look except for at the white of your kindle screen, or the psperback you sre holding.  And the final chapter is exquisitely thrilling, exciting and nail biting.  A final moment of poignancy finishes this classic thriller of the 1990s and you will find yourself a little sad at book's end.  Another true sign of greatness.  At least there are 20 more books to read. I think i have said enough.  This is one of the modern day classics of the genre and i consider myself privileged to have come across it so long after it was released.  The world owes it thanks to James Patterson for giving us such a fantastic tale and yet another superhero to stand up against the evils that exist in our world.

This one takes it nearly as far as it can go. Here's the scoop. The young daughter of a U.S. Senator has been kidnapped. Famed detective Alex Cross is reluctantly brought in. The kidnapper has left some clever clues which Alex, and his secret service partner whose negligence led to the kidnapping, need to follow to retrieve the girl. Surprises abound in the investigation. Overall this is pretty good. It's a major studio release with good production values and a fine cast. Directing, editing, music score are all on par with the budget. I guess I had a problem with the fact that our kidnapper ( the always good Michael Wincott) was so darned clever. Someone would need to be a member of MENSA to figure out these clues. Then, way into the third act there were a couple of 180 degree turns that nearly took my head off. I like a good surprise as much as the next person but these just seemed too much for me. This is an okay watch. It's diverting and entertaining. Just forgive it its weaknesses.</td><td>He Came. He Crawled.

Very vague on what happened to money.  Much of the story left \"incomplete\" in my opinion.  Also struggled with the bruises described as being sustained AFTER death.  As far as I know, that wouldn't have happened unless the \"beating\" happened at the time of death or very shortly thereafter.  Not after finding him already dead.

It it not too often that I can find a psychological mystery to be this exceptional.  The Gary Soneji/Murphy out smarting the police with being a psychopath, potential Multiple personality disorder/ personality fatigue, and being the actor with having homicidal \"1 year/5 year/lifetime plans\" to be famous like he feels he should be is very interesting.  From what I heard (without reading any other Alex cross books), this book will set up for some storylines in the next few books allowing for some interesting storylines for the book now. This book series is the Law and Order: Criminal Intent series of James Patterson.  While the story revolves around the crime and solving the crime, there is a huge element to the psychological, motives and the \"criminal intent\".  It involves the \"ticking\" of the criminal to why they would do the things they would do.  It can range from money to famous to just being a pure psychological evil driven madman.  All in all an A+. In this book by itself, there is one drawback.  It can be really slow sometimes.  After Soneji's trial and conviction (about half way through) starting with part 4, it starts dragging while Alex Cross continues the case.  But it does lead up to a very interesting ending (the last few chapters), in which I will be willing to give it a pass.

He volunteers at a soup kitchen in his neighborhood. He's devoted to his two kids, his grandmother, and the memory of his dead wife. He's in great shape and good looking... Alex will go through a lot of turmoil in this book, and he always has our sympathy. Even the psychopath he's hunting finds something attractive about Alex. Alex is the one he most enjoys playing mind games with, and sharing his twisted fantasies with. The crimes in the story are horrific and not for the squeamish. But the villain of the piece is a fascinating character -- maybe a split personality, maybe just a master manipulator, but certainly a master-criminal since boyhood. Long-range planning of nightmarish deeds is his specialty. There's plenty of action throughout, and a shocking twist at the end. This is my first experience of James Patterson, and I'm impressed. I've ordered the next Alex Cross novel. Hope it's as gripping as this one.</td><td>Appealing detective goes after repulsive psychopath</td><td>1405123200</td><td>1</td><td>books</td><td>2014-07-12</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jul</td><td>59</td><td>56</td><td>646</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td>72771</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>A3EC18BGAY9WD7</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Nicole Ellenson</td><td>I haven't seen the movie, but I thought this book was an enjoyable page-turner.

Due to deeper character development, I probably prefer the book, which I read first,  to the movie but no doubt production time restraints would necessitate some changes. No spoiler alerts here, I won't reveal any differences between the two in case you want to read and/or watch for yourself. I highly recommend reading the book and seeing the movie, in either order you prefer. I will say there are twists and turns in both plus a surprising -- and heartbreaking -- ending that you'll wish didn't happen in both versions. However, there are \"subtle clues\" about it in both the movie and in the book if you're paying close attention! And while the book and the movie end differently, the result is the same; so read the book and watch the movie: you'll find out what I mean. And watch the movie at least twice to see where those sneaky clues were if you missed them the first time. The acting is superb. I can think of no one better to portray Psychiatrist/Profiler/ Detective Alex Cross than Morgan Freeman. He is smart, determined, self-controlled and totally believable in this role. The man exudes \"smarts.\" You can see the gears turning in Morgan Freeman's head as he pieces together clue after clue. There is one scene in particular where you can literally see him \"light up\" when he figures out an all-too-important password. The viewer has confidence in him that he will ultimately outwit everyone, including the bad guys, and blow the case wide open, which he does to everyone's dismay during the film's shocking ending. Monica Potter is an amazing \"emotional\" actress. By that I mean this lady can make you feel her character's pain as well as turn on the tears. [Anyone who did not see her performance in \"Parenthood\" where she wept during her goodbye to a dying friend should watch it on YouTube. It's some of the best acting I've ever seen. And Ms. Potter's realistic characterization of a woman fighting breast cancer on that same show is beyond incredible. No other actress compares to her in my opinion.] In this film she plays Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan, sort of a tag-along partner to Alex Cross. Cross is kind to her and we see a softer side of Cross as he plays devil's advocate for Jezzie after the Senator's daughter she is assigned to protect is kidnapped at a private school. Jezzie beats herself up emotionally over that and also over another blunder she makes later in the film, but the kind and super-intelligent Psychiatrist-Detective Alex Cross boosts Jezzie's ego, lending her both moral support and friendship. They are very good together onscreen. Monica Potter brings out her character's intelligence, humanness and flaws seamlessly. She can handle her firearm too! Again, I can't think of anyone who could have portrayed the character of Jezzie Flannigan any better than Monica Potter. She is young and beautiful and a very skilled actress. I could watch her scenes with Morgan Freeman time and again, and I have. Perfection. Michael Wincott is chilling as the maniacal kidnapper who provides just the right amount of edginess and danger to his character, Gary Soneji. While this character is much more fully developed -- and deadly -- in the book, he is both dangerous enough and smart enough on film to kidnap the Senator's child from her school right from under Jezzie Flannigan's nose: let the cat and mouse games begin between Soneji and Cross/Flannigan. There are plenty of twists and turns in this plot to keep you interested. Mr. Wincott portrays his character with touches of danger and psychosis, making you believe he really is a serial killer! However, this movie character is far less dangerous than the character in the book but that does not make Mr. Wincott any less menacing by any means. Well done. Mika Boorem is simply wonderful as the abducted child. This young lady does an incredible job of showing grit and determination in the face of fear and certain death by her captors. Her acting skills are well beyond her years. Mika Boorem gets to express a range of emotions from trust and love for her Secret Service guardian, Jezzie Flannigan, to confidence in, then apprehension of, her teacher and kidnapper, Gary Soneji. During the film's final tense moments we see Mika bring out the child's cleverness as she fearfully tries to elude and outwit one very bad sociopath determined to kill her. Miss Boorem's character has limited dialog but she plays the terrified yet brainy kidnapped child very well. Kudos to her. Fabulous stuff! An excellent supporting cast includes Michael Moriarity, Penelope Ann Miller and several more. They all are in fine form although Mr. Moriarity's attempt at portraying [perhaps a southern] Senator was a bit \"strained.\" Direction and camera angles are spot on as well in my opinion. Some of my favorite director's scenes are a sequence shot on a train, a \"ransom run\" through D.C., the one of Morgan Freeman in that \"light bulb\" moment, as well as one of Monica Potter's interactions with the child actress, Mika Boorem, late in the film. There are a couple of other fine shots that I liked very much: one of Cross and Flannigan arriving at a crime scene, their vehicle approaching from a distance, then a nice shot of the same vehicle just exiting a marvelous curved bridge. This film is rated \"R\" for violence and language; however, it is extremely mild by today's standards. The violence is not gratuitous nor is it glorified and they don't dwell on it. There is some blood but no gore. The language mostly consists of the \"F\" bomb dropped a few times but then not often and there is some short-lived profanity. Filthy talk is a big turn off for me -- both in movies and in real life -- so I'm grateful \"colorful\" language is at a minimum. The bulk of the film runs without it,the worst of it during the tense opening scene. The rest is mostly just straight and pertinent dialog. I would, however, use discretion in permitting youngsters to watch it. There are a few \"mistakes\" in this movie, as in almost all films. They're minor for the most part but there is one glaring error that you might notice if you're listening closely. I have an eye and ear for detail so I usually readily spot gaffs most people miss. However, it's all small stuff and certainly doesn't detract from the film, the acting or the story in any way. [A challenge: for fun, see if you catch them while you're watching.] I found this film extremely entertaining, well done and well acted. Though I had already read the book, as noted above, I found it a fascinating take on the story and it kept me engrossed to the bitter [literally] end. I have watched it twice and will view it time and again I'm sure. I'm glad to have it in my DVD collection. Watch carefully and enjoy.</td><td>A superb roller coaster ride of suspense and twists!</td><td>1405728000</td><td>0</td><td>books</td><td>2014-07-19</td><td>Sat </td><td>Jul</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>654</td><td>1196</td></tr><tr><td>72764</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>ABP5LUZQ1NXND</td><td>0006476155</td><td>Donald Couture</td><td>Another in a well written series of books featuring Alex Cross.

Of course, they usually are. Several things are left out of the movie that are in the book, and i feel, are important to the whole series. I've read the first 16 or so of the Alex Cross series and they are good. Very easy to read, and makes you want to see what happens to Alex and his family. They aren't edge-of-your-seat thrilling, but still a great read. I originally began reading these because I saw the movies (Kiss the Girls and then Along Came a Spider) and realized they were based off of the books, and decided to read them. Of course, the books are much better than the movies. I haven't seen the latest Alex Cross movie with Tyler Perry and I'm not sure how I feel about Tyler Perry playing Alex Cross. If you're into a series of books, these are a great time killer.
