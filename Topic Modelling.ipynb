It's an interesting take on an alternate reality. I'd recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>My Grandson Loves it!!</td></tr><tr><td>My nine year old son and I enjoyed reading this together.  We learned a lot as we looked up additional information online about Louis IV etc.</td></tr><tr><td>The author has oudone himself. He has made a book so full of misdirection that it was like being ambushed. Action from cover to cover but fewer jokes from our favorite clown. Fry and Cooper seem to be getting along a bit better. At least she is not ratting him out every book. Still too many unanswered questions about her sister and Cooper seems more comfortable now in his apartment. New characters passed through, leaving more questions than answers. A bit of romance for Cooper, but his dedication to the job would be hard for any permanent relationship. Great read. About halway through the books written to this point....shu</td></tr><tr><td>Happy to discover this author.  Like when books draw you in.  I love Maeve Binchy books and CK is along those lines.</td></tr><tr><td>I am about 1/2 way through this book, and the twists and turns this author is doing has me forgetting about housework or watching TV because I can't put it down. I love the way Andrew Gross writes like Jame Patterson books. I love both authors.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was slow going.  Lots of \"He, she said...and she felt\".  It was like watching day time tv and it was like. \"ok. I gotta read this or I won't know what happened to my characters\"...answer. Not a lot.  You mostly find out about how they feel towards each other.  Usually the books pick up in the middle. This didn't.  ...and then it ended.....just ended with a slamming or \"firm placement\" of the telephone. spoiler:  It was neat to see Jenks full sized for a time.  Summary.  If you can get to a copy at the store and read only the last two chapters, it'll clear up a lot and you won't have to sit through the otherwise snooze fest.  I DO like her books and had to buy this one so I'd know what was going on....but just read the very last two chapters and you will.</td></tr><tr><td>I am not one to read \"True Crime\" stories and usually only engage in reading the best of the lot, i.e., \"In Cold Blood\", \"The Onion Field\", \"Fatal Vision\", etc.  I would not put \"A Deadly Game\" in that field, however, that said, I was very suprised at how well the book was written and with the wealth of information included.  My only knock against the book was the author's including her own impressions about Peterson's motives and/or reasons for behavior.  It is ok to speculate but Crier seems to go overboard at times.  Interjecting her own personal observations and then trying to analyze why Peterson said this or did that.  I would also have enjoyed reading more about the trial since I paid little attention to this whole sorid tale.  Being a criminal attorney (stints at both defense and prosecution), I was a concerned about the lack of solid or physical evidence used by the state to convict Peterson.  After reading this book I have no doubt that he killed his young pregnant wife and for that he needs to burn in hell, however, I still feel as though the state did not have sufficient evidence to convict him.  This book, however, is very well written, researched, and grabs you from page one.</td></tr><tr><td>I have read several Sylvis Day books. I can honestly say this one I had to make myself finish the book. It is really the same sex sences as in all her other books.</td></tr><tr><td>The story is naive, so naive that you long for it. It has no complex plot at all, its just as life actually is. And the characters are those that we are familiar with through our lives. In short it's a good and simple read. But then, you fall in love with it! Yu admire every little thing these beautiful people do to build up a life and a future. Francis is every child on earth, her mother is what is hidden in every women, the poor father is one of the most loveable characters in the history of fiction... read, laugh, cry, feel that you live. I don't know why but A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been one of the novels that changed my life. Even though the life told was no different from mine. :)</td></tr><tr><td>Americanah is an interesting love story, but it is too long.  The anti-American theme that runs throughout the book is annoying as are the blogs written by the main character.</td></tr><tr><td>Great books, full of interesting information on how people really lived in the middle ages. Made more accessible by referring to real people with historical facts.</td></tr><tr><td>MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD I have been reading the plight of the Baudalaire Orphans for a while now, and I have loved the series, not only because of the humor, but because of the fact that the author tries to teach his readers by saying things over and over again. However, while this was very entertaining, it is what ultimately led to the downfall of this book. As Danial Handler (Lemony Snicket's legal assistant) said about the book JOHNNY TREMAIN, \"If there is a more tedious novel, I am not aware of it\". Don't get me wrong. I agree 100% (I was forced to read it in 8th grade). But the character of Captain Widdershins certainly gives this awful book a run for its money. His constant usage of the word \"Aye!\" is amusing at first, but it quickly gets old, and by the time he disappears, you won't feel any sympathy for him. The only thing that held the Submarine Q together, in my opinion, was Widdershin's stepdaughter, Fiona. She was sweet, sensible, and introduced a little romance to the story. Unfortunately, when Widdershins disappers, she immediately takes on his personality, as if she is channeling his spirit. Bad juu-juu that is. The fact is, the only time the book picked up was when Sunny met with a particularly nasty unfortunate event in a cave, and the very end of the book. Everything else was extremely tedious. And not in the good way (like in all the other books). Who should read this? Anyone who is a fan of the series should give it a try. If you like it, kudos to you, because you are a very intelligant person who can get past all of the confusing vocabulary, and the name \"Medusoid Mycelium\". And if you don't, that's okay. Hopefully, the final two books will bring us back to what hooked us to the series in the first place.</td></tr><tr><td>This book moved me on so many levels.  I was captivated throughout and found it to be  be funny a d heartbreaking all at once.  I'm so glad I  stumbled upon it.</td></tr><tr><td>It is hard to imagine that a book this shallow could become a best seller. With the wealth of fine, complex and challenging books one could read to spark contemplation about one's life path, why would any adult choose this one? I forced myself to finish it out of loyalty to my book club, but like several others we've been \"conned\" into reading by clueless reviewers (The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the Four Agreements) it is at its core a quick buck book. Apparently, if you repackage any simple truism you heard from Grandma in the nursery, you can rake in many dollars from the gullible. I am just glad I followed my heart and got the book from the library. I'll give the money saved to a good cause as part of my path to my personal legend.</td></tr><tr><td>Powerful!</td></tr><tr><td>Well done. Fun story to help prep new big brothers.</td></tr><tr><td><a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Explosive-Eighteen-A-Stephanie-Plum-Novel/dp/0345527712/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Explosive Eighteen: A Stephanie Plum Novel</a> As usual, Stephanie and Lula have their difficulties and Joyce appears in this one too.  I didn't care as much for the story line in this one, but it was still good entertainment.  I read mysteries and psychological thrillers as a rule.  However, I always look forward to Ms. Evanovich's books.  They're light, fun reading and I wouldn't miss any of them.</td></tr><tr><td>One of the best 'historical' series ever written, 'Flashman' rates right up there with the Patrick O'Brian Jack Aubrey series!  I won't spoil the tale, but basically, Flashman is the beginning tale of the long career of a thorough cad and scalliwag, bouncing from one disaster to the next throughout the world of the 19th Century in a manner somewhat reminiscent of 'Forrest Gump,' though with none of the naivete.  Because of the various events Flashman becomes involved with, it is almost impossible for his career to be anything other than what he is (anything more 'noble' would have been killed off in infancy!), and it is splendid to see the hypocrisy of the Victorian world exposed for what it was... preposterous noble sentiments glossed over with religious overtones, all concealing a rapacity, bigotry and greed that has rarely been seen in any other time frame.  Excellent history (you will learn a lot!), splendid imagery, and altogether, you can't ask for much more in this genre!</td></tr><tr><td>The author really captures Southern style! I love her characters and the stories that she weaves.  A nice, fun, entertaing book!</td></tr><tr><td>I had to read this book more than once to comprehend it. It has high-minded political points to make, as well as a cloudy narrative that often feels like it comes from an untrustworthy source. Reading this book feels like someone has dropped you off in Oz with binoculars glued to your face. So you stumble through this amazing world, only able to view it in these fragmented, way-too-close-to-discern-the-big-picture scenes and images. The characters seem to have full lives outside of the reader's view, which ends up making the reader feel isolated and confused rather than intrigued, especially as relationships deepen outside the narrative.</td></tr><tr><td>The full title of this book is The Professor and the Madman, A Tale of  Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  Curiously, this is only one of at least two books on this topic.  Stranger  still, the first few pages has many, many, reviews - all postive, from  people who have never agreed on anything, until they read this book.  Intriqued, I purchased it. The title, of course, gives you a general  outline about this book.  But the author, Mr. Winchester, has written about  much more then the long title suggests.  This books is also about personal  relationships, history, and, indirectly, the death penalty today. First  though, it is a book about the dictionary.  Specifically the Oxford English  Dictionary or the OED.  I love learning the history of words so, in a way,  the history of the book of words, the dictionary, was a nature step. Mr. Winchester talks about the history of the dictionary from Samuel  Johnson to the reference books relied upon by William Shakesphere.  In the  process he also talks about how other nations from France to Italy defined  themselves, in part, but how they created books to define their words.  France, for example, is still guarding its language from the encroachment  of foreign langages - usually American English or Japanese. But this book  is about much more then that.  The author has done alot of research, and it  shows.  His command of the facts and the times is amazing.  I learned new  things, for examples, about the American Civil War, even though I was a  history major who has studied this period, intermitedly, for the past 10  years. More impressive is his desciption of the charactors.  Each person  here is a real in this book as they were in real life.  Well, I never met  them so I can't say for sure, but the entire book has the feeling of a  letter from an old friend.  The letter may say something important, or not,  but the way it is written and the references that an old friend can make,  which makes the letter come alive. After reading this book I was  actually a little sad that I would not be visiting with these people again,  my new/old friends.  I was hoping for a sequel which, based on the subject  material, is impossible.  I will just have to satify myself with  Mr.  Winchester's next efforts, which, I hope will be soon.</td></tr><tr><td>Tesss life is turned upside down when she looses her job and on top of that shes in love with her best friend Charlie. She has been for the last 10 years. And in a night where shes frustrated, drunk and down, it happens. The next morning she confesses her feelings and he just says all the wrong things!!! When she gets the opportunity to get away and be someone else, she takes it. She takes her flatmate Vanessas job and flies to Hawaii for a photo shoot, where shes the photographer. Hawaii is great!!! I loved reading about the islands and it sounds like an awesome place. The man who owns part  of the island and should be in the spotlight for the photos and interviews cancels all the time. There is Kekipi, who looks after everything in the cottages and also turns out to be a great friend to Tess. He was great, I love the scenes with him, it made the story even funnier and catchier. Now, lets talk about Nick: sexy, smart, arrogant Nick. Somehow he is just what Tess needs. She lets go and is herself and also he sees that. He comes across as a real macho and arrogant man, who doesnt want a real relationship. Well, he also thinks she is Vanessa, so theres that problem, but more about that later The two of them have a lot of fun together and their chemistry is great. When he wants he can be a real sweetheart and romantic as well. Paige is there as well, she is interested in Nick When she finds out about Nick and Tess, shes furious and is about to tell everyone to truth about Vanessa/Tess. Tess is lovely and I loved it, how she opened up more and more with the right people. It was lovely to read about her getting to know Al at the beach and it turned out to be great for the whole job situation. Eventually, Nick finds out about her real name and its just when he seems to realise that there could be more and he also knows about her situation with Charlie. Bach at home Tess has to figure everything out. There are some great opportunituies for her job wise and also in other directions. What about Charlie, what does he feel now? What about Nick? Does he even want to talk to her anymore? Decisions have to be made and Lindsey only lets us know in the next book of this series: What a Girl Wants, coming out July 17th. I cant wait!!!! Oh and Im deffo in Team Nick  Oh and the real Vanessa, such a b****, I didn't like her at all. Amy, tess best friend was great, loved having her in the story. This book was AWESOME!!! Catchy, gripping, hilarious and brilliantly written. A bit of an unusual storyline, but I love it!!! My favourite Lindsey Kelk book so far!!!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a book that has left me feeling rather disturbed. But in a good way. While I did find the premise a bit hard to swallow in some ways (such as the idea that the \"virus\" kills everyone at the exact same age, with no variation), the character interaction was great. I'm curious to see where this story is going...</td></tr><tr><td>Yet another good Odd adventure, just enough humor to keep it light, but also several thought-provoking ideas. And another sweet Golden</td></tr><tr><td>All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters.</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't like this one. It was rather boring and tedious and the characters were selfish, annoying, and unlikable. Usually I like Shriver's extremely detailed descriptions and insight into the character's thoughts and motives, but these characters were pretentious, irritating, arrogant, and uninteresting so it was really boring. I only finished it coz I usually really like her writing so I was hoping it would get better. It did, but barely. It was a nice, tidy ending, but not worth the rest of the tedium. I'll continue to read Shriver because I do like her writing and story lines, but I wouldn't recommend this one. At all.</td></tr><tr><td>My first Agatha Christie book. I enjoyed it very much. Kept me guessing until the last sentence. Very cleverly done.</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Woods weaves an intriguing tale in this book that makes it difficult to put down.  It's not difficult reading, and so I think I finished it in two or three days.  The plot is fun and the protagonists are easy to root for!  A surprising ending makes it worth sticking around to the end.</td></tr><tr><td>So this was another great continuance of the series but it's only half the characters! The next book will have the remaining characters that were missing in the timeline...</td></tr><tr><td>Started reading this book at the Clogerie de Lilas where supposedly Hemingway wrote the book, and fell in love with his economy of style.</td></tr><tr><td>The extravagant hype surrounding Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel serves only to create a camouflage of unreasonable expectations and subverts an extremely promising career beginning, a promise left as yet unfulfilled. Like Zadie Smith's \"White Teeth\" (but without her degree of tonal control), Mr. Foer writes beyond our expectations of one so young, and ambitiously, with humour and humanity. The novel, however, is wildly uneven, veering between cut-rate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, abbreviated William Styron and a witty lyricism all his own. The stabs at humour frequently become repetitious or fall flat and his experimental narrative constructions are only intermittently successful as well. But he gets full marks for effort and, when his writing works, as it frequently does, it is a joy to read. So if \"Everything\" is approached ignoring the hype, it has enough delights to reward your effort.</td></tr><tr><td>So refreshing!</td></tr><tr><td>I don't care what all these people are saying about the writing style! If you saw the movie and really enjoyed it, then you will love the book too. The book will make you cry even more than the movie did (I had to stop reading it a couple of times on the train because I started to cry). I probably don't care too much about the writing because I'm not the best writer either, but I didn't read the book to be challenged by reading. I didn't really notice the HORRIBLE writing that everyone is talking about. I read it because I wanted to laugh and cry and everything else that this book makes a person feel. The movie is just LOOSELY based on the novel, but overall I thought the book was better, I'm not a big fan of Hillary Swank but Gerard Butler will make me want to watch any movie, which is how I ended up finding out about this book anyway. But overall I say if you enjoyed the movie and want more of a story and more details. I would recommend this book to anyone! It was great, and I'm sad I'm finished reading it.</td></tr><tr><td>The Tudor time period is without a doubt one of my favorites. I love the dresses, the scandal, the royals, just about everything except the downfalls to that time, so when the chance arose to read The Stolen One, I jumped at, eager to devour a new addition to this genre. Thankfully, Suzanne Crowley's The Stolen One proved to not only be a beautifully written and intriguing tale of one girl's journey to find who she is at the royal court of the grand Elizabeth, but a book that will have readers begging for more from this very talented author! From page one, Suzanne allows her wonderful storytelling to transport you into the world of Kat, a character who while has faced much heartbreak still manages to be one strong girl who you can't help but to root for and love. It was fun and at times heartbreaking to be there right along with Kat as discovered the many secrets left behind for her to unravel the mystery of who she is and how she could overcome the hardships she faces because of it. In addition, Suzanne introduced many rich secondary characters such as Christian, a boy who would do anything for the young Kat, Elizabeth, someone Suzanne managed to portray quite well, and Anne, Kat's beautiful yet crippled sister, to mention a few. Leaving the characters of this story to be one of my favorite parts. The plot of this almost never had a dull moment. Though, I didn't particularly like how the mystery of who Kat's mother was could be told from a mile away and how quickly the book wrapped up with almost no pivoting point, but I did like the other mysteries that arose throughout this, the addition of Grace's diary, and the romance. Along with how Kate's character grew greatly and the lessons she learned through that. Adding to this, Crowley's writing was spectacular and continued to amaze me with just how far she went to bring this story to life! In all The Stolen One is a book that I highly suggest you pick up, especially if you're a Tudor history fan like me. Grade: A-</td></tr><tr><td>Stephanie Plum is a funny and resourceful character. Unemployed Plum gets a job  with her cousin's bailbond agency to capture a bail jumper.  Plum meets a pyscho boxer, steals the bail jumper's car, and attends family dinners. This is a light-hearted detective novel. Stephanie's character drives this novel.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was fascinating.  I loved the premise, the way it was told and the way the ideas were developed.  I listened to the Audible version and the narration was great.  As other people have commented, this book does have a split, and it was jarring, but once I adjusted I enjoyed the second part as much as the first.  Different but good.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy, so I figured I'd give her new Liveship Trilogy a shot as well.  The first hundred pages or so were a bit slow, leaving me to wonder if I was going to be disappointed by an author who had so impressed me when I was first introduced to her. Lucky for me, she proved my suspicions to be unfounded! Soon after those hundred pages, I was eating up the story, truly enraptured in all the characters and their plights.  What I love about Hobb is that she really makes you love the characters you're supposed to love and hate the characters you're supposed to hate.  She illicits very strong emotions...at least from me anyway.  I loved this book and I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy to find out what happens next!</td></tr><tr><td>Book club did this and at first it did not sound interesting to me.  Then it grabbed me and I was caught.  A very interesting and thought provoking story.  It has an unanswerable question of \"what would I do\".  it truly melted my heart because different perspectives are so relatable.  Truly a story that will stay with you.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is inspirational and practical, filled with excellent advice that, if followed, can help anyone (not just teens) achieve success. I purchased more than one, and will purchase again to give as Christmas gifts. Excellent read!</td></tr><tr><td>For anyone who has ever loved a dog or cat.  This is a wonderful story full of love lost and love found for humans and pets alike.  Some very interesting people trying to get their lives on an even keel and a very perceptive dog who helps them get it together.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent book!! I had forgotten how wonderful Ernest Hemmingway's stories are and was very pleasantly surprised. I did not lay down the book until I finished it. It was pure entertainment, I have a few more of his books waiting to be read right now because of this one.</td></tr><tr><td>I've read it twice and loved it...Even though it's about poverty in Ireland, it's not about poverty, it's not about Ireland...it's about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.  McCourt's writing style is  what lends it the most credibility...in the beginning it has the quality of  a child telling a story and it matures as he does throughout the book.  I  didn't care much for his \"afterschool activities\" in the later  chapters...the book could have done without them, but I guess the crucial  part of any memoir is the truth through your own eyes.  The last chapter is  perfect!  I'd reccomend to anyone!</td></tr><tr><td>I realize this book was written a hundred years ago, and perhaps there it should stay. No action. People talking way too much.  Not a good read.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked the story and the character development.  I did not read the story before this one, which I understand explains more of the main character's involvement in designing and manufacturing shoes.  There must be a third book to explain how she will balance career and family!  Easy read that makes you happy and feel life is full of possibilities.</td></tr><tr><td>Joseph O'Neill's elegant novel about an English cricket player in post-9/11 New York is an interesting, though ultimately superficial and topical portrait of a Gatsby-esque friendship between a Dutchman and Trinidadian who go into business together. Hans' wife is leaving him and is disgusted with the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The writing falls into the pitfalls of polemics; Rachel's diatribe against the war on terror is a flat and contrived bit of historical tagging. There are finely crafted moments of narration, with many elegant descriptions of New York. But Netherland is a slim and uninteresting little book with unlikely scenarios and dialogue, and the relationships are manipulated for the sake of O'Neill's artificial political posturings.</td></tr><tr><td>A brutal, powerfully desperate collection of short stories about themes of addiction, ruin, and redemption. Johnson has succeeded in continuing what may be called the dirty realist tradition of Carver in a way that few have donehis is a prose that is bare-boned in its rawness and clarity. While minimalist depictions of the down-and-out tend, traditionally, to contract in expressivity, Johnsons assemblage of destitution only expands with energy and a bizarrely touching moments of renewal. A truly fine work of literature, marred only by the occasional clichs of his genre.</td></tr><tr><td>How great to see Ty Hauck again.  He is just as caring for the underdog as ever.  When the farmer who lost his son won't take his help, that doesn't deter him in the least!!  He works around it until he finds the Real reason the farmer is being so obstinate.  The town has been bought.....money and soul!!  Tagging along, or maybe HE's doing the tagging along, is his Goddaughter, who not only knows her way around the rapids in Colorado, but also happens to be the person who found her friend, Trey's, body.  She won't rest until she gets some answers to what Really happened on that river to Trey, hence the reason her stepfather (also the local sheriff) locked her up, for what he called her 'own safety.'  In the meantime, her real Dad calls Ty to please go check into the trouble his Goddaughter seems to have gotten into, and needless to say, things got tense and scary soon after his arrival.  (Have you noticed how Ty attracts all of that trouble?  Yeah, me, too, and I love it)  You will be so engrossed, you won't put the book down until the end - guaranteed!!  Thanks, Andrew Gross, for another thrilling ride!!</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't expect to like this story as much as I did. It got my attention from the first pages. It described a woman dealing with childhood trauma in a humorous and hones way. I'll never forget Eleanor Oliphant..</td></tr><tr><td>It was just like being there and seeing what went on behind the scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Mr Reagan was the best president we have had during my lifetime and it was just like having a personal interview with him.</td></tr><tr><td>Disappointed in the illustrations.  Was looking unsuccessfully for the edition I had as a child. Cover was a little beaten up, but I expected that; it's very old.  I enjoyed re-reading the beautiful old poems.  Brought back wonderful memories of my granny reading them to me. I hope the mommy and baby-to-be to whom I'm giving this precious book will enjoy it as much as I.</td></tr><tr><td>Let's be honest ok? Did anyone out there really expect this one to be good? If so, you're delusional. Admit it: Koontz's track record has been just ghastly as of late. The guy has let me down so many times that I would be flat out surprised if anything decent came out of this newest Odd novel. Well, clearly as you can see, my prediction proved true. \"Deeply Odd\" was awful. Really though, should this even come as a shock? Before we delve into the waste of paper (or hard drive space since mine was on the Kindle), that \"Deeply Odd\" was, let's go back and answer that question with a brief trip down memory lane and into Koontz's biography for the last, 7 or 8 years. In that time are there any books that bare any sort of praise? I honestly can't think of a single one I really liked. There were a few ok ones, sure, like<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/What-the-Night-Knows-A-Novel/dp/0553807722/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">What the Night Knows: A Novel</a>&nbsp;and even the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Odd-Apocalypse-An-Odd-Thomas-Novel/dp/0553593099/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Odd Apocalypse: An Odd Thomas Novel</a>&nbsp;did show some promise, but within that time frame he somehow managed to write the god awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Breathless/dp/B007231B56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Breathless</a>, the horrendous&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Darkest-Evening-of-the-Year-A-Novel/dp/0345533283/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Darkest Evening of the Year: A Novel</a>, the boring conclusion to the at one time promising \"Frankenstein\" series and not only his worst one up to this, but one of the worst books ever written:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/77-Shadow-Street-with-bonus-novella-The-Moonlit-Mind-A-Novel/dp/0553593064/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">77 Shadow Street (with bonus novella The Moonlit Mind): A Novel</a>.  Koontz has really been on a downward slump these last few years. If he were a professional athlete, he'd have had his walking papers many seasons ago. Like an aging pitcher that throws nothing but HR's, Koontz is aging and not doing it well. That being said, \"Deeply Odd\" is bad. I don't know where to start with it, it was that bad. The plot was bad. The characters were bad. The dialogue was bad. The attempted uses at humor were bad. Koontz's never ending right wing paranoia was bad. The action was bad. Even the rushed and boring conclusion was bad. Any single one of those things would be enough to write a scathing review on, but I am going to keep it to a minimum for time's sake and to keep me from looking to much like a babbling idiot. I will start at the plot. It wasn't the worst in recent memory but its been done before. By Koontz. 3 TIMES IN A ROW!!!!! Yes, \"Shadow Street\" dealt with an alternative sort of reality. \"Apocalypse\" did as well. Now we are subjected to this kind of idea for the 3rd time in as many books! Either Koontz has run out of ideas (and is getting senile in his old age) or he has come to the conclusion that his readers are stupid and have forgotten that this has been told to us thrice! Speaking of forgetting, it sure seems that Koontz has forgotten how to write his own creations. In the first 3 \"Odd\" books, Odd Thomas was a lovable character dealing with this talent (or curse, depending on how you saw fit to feel about him). He accepted this lot in life with little complaint and while he sometimes moped and went introspective, he was generally a happy-go-lucky guy, afraid of violence and hurting people. Now Odd is a gun-loving, emo kid with an all too apparent chip on his shoulder about losing his beloved Stormy. He whines constantly and cries continuously about his life. He says he still abhors violence and still hates guns, but for someone who feels that way, he sure knows how to describe his dual-wielding Glocks, his kevlar vest, and his top secret, government issued sleeping spray/powder. He seems to be extremely talents with said weapons as well as he's seen killing at least 5 people in this installment. That works out to be more than dead bodies than in all the other books combined. Oh, and now he is totally ok with stealing things too, justifying his actions with some horribly lame excuses. Don't misunderstand me here. If Odd would have started out this way, it wouldnt be so bad, but now that he's done a complete 180 so fast shows that Koontz is losing his faith in his character. Maybe you can blame that all on Mrs. Fischer, the gun-totting, limo driving, confusing-as-hell, 86 year old woman who miraculously shows up to save Odd after he somehow manages to survive crashing an SUV that he has stollen. She randomly appears, makes Odd her driver and proceeds to talk away for the next 140 pages about things that make no sense and have no bearing whatsoever in the story. I'm serious people. This is the depths that Koontz has fallen! I've read better dues ex machinas in children's stories. I've also read better dialogue in them too. The back and forth discussions, conversations, and inner monologues are laughably bad. No, wait. I take that back. They are cringe worthy and headache inducing. One such example goes accordingly: \"It's a thing-a-ma-bob,\" Mrs. Fischer said. \"A thing-a-ma-bob?\" I asked \"A dohickey\" \"Dohickey?\" \"A thing-a-ma-bob dohickey. They implanted it in my right buttock. Or maybe it was my left.\" \"Why would they plant a thing-a-ma-bob dohickey in your butt cheek?\" Mrs. Fischer leaned forward and pinched my cheek. \"You're a cute one, Mr. Odd.\" That's it. If I'm lying, I'm dying. Throughout this entire novel the readers have to crawl through these kind of inane and pointless fillers with no reason other than they are there to take up space. Take out these conversations and you're left with a story that would probably be only 1/4 as long. And that 25% would only come at the last part of the story because it isn't until you've slogged through the previous 75% of \"Deeply Odd\" that you finally come to any action and any kind of plot worth mentioning. What is that plot you ask? Well let's just say Koontz relies on age old demon mythology and some naturally evil people to explain why things happen. Like that alternate reality thing we previously mentioned, this has been done numerous times before too. I wouldn't have had a problem with this (after all I read countless zombie stories that are basically the same plot over and over again) but only if had been done well. Obviously this time it wasn't. Dean Koontz has frustrated, disappointed, pissed me off, and let me down for the very last time. I, in good conscious, can no longer support an author with no motivation to write anything good anymore. To continue to waste time, money, and even electricity recharging my kindle while reading his stuff, is just a constant, never ending circle of depression and anger. So with all that being said and these facts laid bare and open before you, Mr. Koontz, I bid you farewell. Should we ever have the possibility to cross paths, I do hope it will be in the company of your older stories and creations.</td></tr><tr><td>In a story so full of horror and suffering, you come away with the true understanding of forgiveness. Here was a man, and a country, so paralyzed with the after affects of war, that they were struggling with how to continue, and a man, who suffered indescribable suffering, found the faith to forgive.</td></tr><tr><td>Having seen the movie more times  than I can count, I decided to read  the book.  I can only say that the  book was not a disappointment.  Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of  character that you hate one minute  and love the next.  I was inspired  by her determination to survive, but  shocked at the schemes she came up  with. While the book may be rather  long, you won't be able to put it  down once you start it.</td></tr><tr><td>It took me forever to read it. Confusing phrases causing to have to reread. Did not like. Finished it by the hardest.</td></tr><tr><td>I received my own set of Little House books some time while I was elementary school-aged.  I'm now 27 and have read the entire series an average of once a year.  Every time I come back to these wonderful books, I'm swept into a warm, familiar, comforting world.  I have real admiration for the Ingalls family; they are such an example of a loving, hardworking, strong family.  These books are funny, sad, harrowing, enchanting, soothing, astonishing, and ultimately life-affirming.  Do I gush?  They've been lifelong friends to me, and I would recommend them to anyone of any age, race, or religion.  Truly classic.</td></tr><tr><td>The book itself was fantastic as are all the Discworld books. Unfortunately, a footnote in the middle of the Kindle edition took me back to the wrong spot in the book and none of the others were right after that. Would be five stars if not for that.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td></tr><tr><td>I think the reader of the SAS Survival Guide would also benefit from a survival guide that focused exclusively on the readers own region.  But the SAS guide presents a very fine overview of survival in just about any region and circumstance.  It is a must have for any survivalist.</td></tr><tr><td>4.5 stars This was my favorite Rachel Morgan book so far. It was very suspenseful! I liked that Rachel \"grew up\" a little and admitted some things about herself. I loved what transpires with Rachel and Nick's relationship. Rachel Weres in this book and increases her witch skills and the further development of Rachel and Ivy's relationship adds another layer of depth. This book really explored the vampire/shadow relationship as well. And Jenks! Jenks is big almost the entire book! You really get to know Jenks better in this book. Overall, a very enjoyable read from Kim Harrison. Just One Gripe: Why does Rachel have to get beaten up every single book? The Best Thing About This Book: Jenks!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good book, but I cried at the end. Good for people who like suspense,action,and drama. Also good for people who like the hunger games series.</td></tr><tr><td>Great story about certain characters and leaves you in suspense about other characters. Really looking forward to the next book!!!</td></tr><tr><td>beautiful and classic, glad i own it. perfect to read and have out at christmas time</td></tr><tr><td>A classic!</td></tr><tr><td>Well written and interesting. A true classic.  Should be required reading by all liberal arts majors. Balance the liberal thinkers.</td></tr><tr><td>I love all of the Heather Wells Mysteries.  A friend bought me one recently and I ended up reading that one and bought the rest of the series. Sometimes, it just nice to read a book, enjoy what you read, not really have to think too hard while you are reading it, but it still have a plot!  It's one of those laugh out loud type of books that everyone in the room wants to know what you are reading that is so funny!</td></tr><tr><td>I decided to read this book, of course, because I love the movie The Sound of Music and I've always been curious about what happened to the Von Trapps after they crossed those mountains, and I've always wanted to know how their lives changed when they came to America. The plot of the movie takes up only the first few chapters of the book and is, honestly, quite different in many respects. Maria, who is a teacher, is sent to tutor one of the Von Trapp children before taking her vows and becoming a full-fledged nun. The children all have different names in real life, by the way. Not sure why. Anyway, Maria goes to the Von Trapp home, meets the children and their father, who does have a whistle to call his children but is otherwise a very nice man and father who only avoids his kids because they remind him too much of his dead wife. The Captain is engaged to a princess (not baroness) who quickly leaves the picture after telling Maria that the Captain is in love with her. The family begins to make music together, Georg proposes, and the Mother Superior forces Maria to marry him even though she doesn't really want to. Hitler takes over Austria and the Von Trapps leave Europe in a very legal way without being chased by armed Nazis. Then the real bulk of the story begins, when Maria tells of their journey to and life in America. It was all interesting, albeit a little too focused on religion for my liking...but to each his own. There were some things that I found odd as I read about the lives of the Von Trapps and their ten children (yes, Maria and Georg had three more on top of the original seven) and all the honorary family members they met along the way. Most noticeably, I thought the kids were TOO nice. They never disobeyed their parents, they went to mass every morning, they prayed every day, they were not the least bit distracted or corrupted by life on the road in America, they never complained about wearing those traditional Austrian costumes everywhere they went. Those kids seemed like robots, honestly, especially when you stop and realize that they are now full grown adults and their parents still treat them like the children they were back in Austria. Overall, glad I read this. It satisfied my curiosity, but doesn't compare with the awesomeness that is the movie</td></tr><tr><td>Let me just say that the intensity of this book is no joke! It's intense all the way through. But I was disappointed with the last half of the book. It left me with a lot of questions.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent</td></tr><tr><td>The book gets on the \"Zombies attacks the world\" band wagon with Richard playing the Brad Pitt part of course.  The book picks up just after the First File rescues Richard and Kahlan from Jit and then the Zombie like people attacks the group out of no where.  How the Seeker of Truth gets out of this is very interesting especially when Richard does not have access to his gift and you find out some more about the war that raged three thousand years ago as the Zombie like people were actually weapons that were created during that war.  Also someone special comes back to life as I will not spoil it for the new readers but for me the book did keep my interest but I did find the new character Samantha a bit annoying.  The story ends on a sad note as someone special dies but also you know the story will continue on with Richard and Kahlan.  Good read for the Sword of Truth fans and highly recommended</td></tr><tr><td>This book left me feeling - MEH (at best)!  I hate when I put a book down and feel utterly disappointed.....I  was truly robbed of approximately 10 hours of my life! Not only was the ending absolutely given away by the mid-point of this book but there was some weird incest storyline happening (ok, maybe not quite incest but close enough to be yucky). I was positive that there was a huge twist at the end but there wasn't.  Not a fan.....</td></tr><tr><td>Forget ALL the movies ever made about this book. They all say a lot more about the trashy cultural milieu they were made in than they do about the actual point of Mary Shelly's story. Forget EVERYTHING you already think you know about the story of Frankenstein. Start over again. Read the book. There's a message there, and not one single mention of lightning, electrodes, or the stolen bodies and brains of deceased criminals. Just read it.  Your admiration for Mary and Percy Shelly will go through the roof, and your admiration of Hollywood will go in the toilet... where it belongs.</td></tr><tr><td>I strive to provide only constructive feedback to readers, because it is far too easy to criticize the hard work and talent of authors. I hope this is perceived as being constructive. First, the narration was very solid and did not distract from the story. Next, I found the overall story to be student-level and formulaic. Plot components seemed to be added to complete some literary equation, rather than being thoroughly considered, and well integrated into the storyline. That said, the story started quite well and was interesting to follow through about the first three of five hours, and then a sudden change in direction had the reader dealing with faith issues and animosity towards a family member of strong faith, causing what I considered to be superfluous and distracting arguments which added nothing to the main plot. For me, the most egregious faux pas made by the author was the \"who\" in whodunit. There were no clues along the way that led the reader to consider the perpetrator, and the behavior of this person, once exposed, bordered on ridiculous. Unlike a Harlan Coben-style story that neatly weaves the several threads of a story into a tightly woven fabric which supports all elements of the story and leaves the reader saying \"wow, that was a great story\", the skein of this novel was more of an \"open weave\". Finally, without meaning to sound sexist, this story contained far too many \"feelings\" and relationship elements which added little to the story, including an entirely incredible plot turn that had the family member who professed very strong personal faith jettisoning her chosen life path after one brief meeting with the main character. This seemed like an afterthought to tie up the last remaining story element, and left me shaking my head and placing an \"X\" next to the author's name in my list of future literary pursuits. Using the \"Netflix\" rating scale where 3=Liked It and 2=Didn't Like It, I chose the lower rating.</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting book.  True to the formula and quite readable.  I enjoyed it but was surprised when it ended with so many pages left at the end.  Turns out they're just v e r y extensive notes.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was definitely for entertainment and if you are looking for an eloquent novel with award winning quality---this is not the book for you.  It is a catty, all girly-like, sometimes vicious tale told by an imperfect character dealing with a worse case scenario social group.  I think if you are the type of reader that fully wants to relate to the 'heroine'--you should skip this one but if you would just like to escape into a light read and be an outsider looking in, this book is a fun read.</td></tr><tr><td>Story in Where the Wild Things Are, unfolds beautifully, as Max feels distance from his mother, Max's bedroom undergoes an enigmatic transformation into a jungle environment, and he winds up sailing to an island inhabited by malicious beasts, the Wild Things. After successfully intimidating the creatures, Max becomes the king of the Wild Things and delight in a romp with them; however, he decides to return home, to the Wild Things' disappointment. After arriving in his bedroom, he discovers a hot supper waiting for him. Read a full review at http://alwayskeepgrowing.com/2014/11/maurice-sendak-where-the-wild-things-are/</td></tr><tr><td>Of course, this book is partly out-of-date. It covers mainly the Clinton years. But the issues it tackles are still very actual. - the unemployment issue: Manpower is still the number one US employer and corporate downsizing continues unabatingly - the salary issue: worker's salaries are still less today in real dollar terms than in 1979 - the CEO salary issue: a CEO earns 212 times more than an average worker - the healthcare issue: more than 40 million US citizens cannot afford healthcare insurance - the voting issue: why is only a small part of the US population voting? - the abortion issue: 'outlawing abortion would mean a return to the good old dirty, unsafe days of illegal abortion' - the corporate representation issue: few blacks or workers - the race and affirmative action issue: still necessary - the immigration issue: all US citizens are descendants of immigrants - the corporate fraud issue: Enron and Co - the welfare v. Aid to Dependent Corporations issue and most amazing of all, 'the balanced budget issue', proposed by the Reps. But once in office, the Reps digged enormous holes in the budget by offering heavy tax cuts to the super-wealthy! However, Michael Moore committed also a colossal blunder: 'Democrat? Republican? Can you tell the Difference?' That Michael Moore's voice is terribly feared by the wealthy, the powerful, the conservatives and the religious right, is mercilessly exposed in the excellent movie 'This divided State' by Steven Greenstreet. We need his vitriolic voice.</td></tr><tr><td>The entire Robin Hobb series flows smoothly, is creative and never dull.  This is actually book 5 of the series.  There is the original trilogy then the follow up Tawny Man Trilogy, which is a follow up following a 15-year break (in the book).</td></tr><tr><td>Love Churchill's wit & humor. Highly recommend this book!</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not going to write out a review of the books contents/plot (which is just wonderful. One of my Favorite books) . Just on the new cover. It's stunning. I'm so glad that Neil was able to get Robert McGinnis to do new artwork for his books. His style is just spectacular. I own all of Neil's books and have read them many times over. But I fell in love with the new art so I just had to order all of the new books for the covers. They are going to be prominately displayed in my cozy little home library.</td></tr><tr><td>Perfect to fill (replace) the void of Martin, Stevenson, Lynch & Rothfuss! Good tale well told! Good character development throughout!</td></tr><tr><td>Great shape! Love this book! there was a slight tear on the cover but that is perfectly okay. it was an amazing find!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very good follow-on from the earlier Gone books. Well crafted and the twists in the plot make it a real page turner.</td></tr><tr><td>the best books for girls</td></tr><tr><td>AWSOME SO COOOL BEST BOOK I EVER READ SO FAR ONLY12 BUT STILLL LOVE THE BOOK CAN'T WAIT TO READ ALLIEGENT YESYESYES</td></tr><tr><td>I really wondered what this book was about the first 20 pages.  As I got more involved in the story, I realized what an interesting concept it was.  I became fascinated by the various characters and their reaction to captivity.  I started rooting for the captors and wishing there was some way to transform them.  The book ended quickly but I wanted to hear about the effect on each hostage.  Well done Ann Patchett!</td></tr><tr><td>I have the luxury of having just read this book in July 2011, right after A Dance with Dragons was published.  Therefore, I knew that some of the characters who seemed to be ignored in this book would be addressed in the next book which I am about to read.  Nonetheless, I strongly felt that the story continued to be as engrossing as it had been in the previous three novels and can see how Mr. Martin is developing and evolving the overall story of the Song of Ice and Fire.  While some of the \"cliffhangers\" might drive some readers to distraction and anger, I feel that the story continues to paint a picture where \"good\" and \"evil\" are not hand-delivered to the reader.  Rather, he or she must make his or her own decisions about a great many of the characters presented and accept the idea that, for the most part, no one falls entirely under one umbrella or the other.  This is a rare gift that Tolkien himself did not tackle and is only present in the writings of immortals like Shakespeare or Milton.</td></tr><tr><td>Now that, my dear friends - is a piece of quality writing. *MINI REVIEW:* This book left me speechless - the writing style, the characters and the overall cohesiveness of the storyline was amazing and well thought-out We are told of the events occurring in Jay Gatsby's life from the perspective of one of his close friends Nick Carraway. I found this quite an interesting approach and perspective which suited the book well. The novel is full of vivid imagery and the language that Fitzgerald uses had me in awe with his ability to pull the reader so deeply into the story. This book did have a tragic end unfortunately, and things do not exactly end on a bright and rosy note. In a way Fitzgerald made everything so cleverly ironic that you come to think that really, everything ended just as it should have. I would definitely recommend this as one of the must-reads and best literary classics of the 20th century!</td></tr><tr><td>I'll have to admit out of all Barbara Micheals' books that I have read so this one is the most chilling/scary one I have ever read. When you start reading it. It seems a bit slow at first but gets better because you can almost feel that erie coldness and chill down your spine. It a while to walk off the feeling of uneasiness after reading the book even after I read a second time. I recommend this book to all fans of Barbara Micheals and those that love books that send chills to your bones.</td></tr><tr><td>Far too much musing about this and that....could barely finish the book. The girls school setting was too very squishy!</td></tr><tr><td>I think he dragged this book out. A lot of the words were useless to the story so it took patience to finish it.</td></tr><tr><td>Randall, along with many other, such as Susskind&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Cosmic-Landscape-String-Theory-and-the-Illusion-of-Intelligent-Design/dp/0316013331/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design</a>&nbsp;makes a serious mistake in leaping to the conclusion that reality corresponds to her mathematical models. Along with other string theorists, they assume that if the math they use to build their models contains some number of additional dimensions, then the real world must contain those dimensions. I see this in much of the literature, including, for example Woit&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Not-Even-Wrong-The-Failure-of-String-Theory-And-the-Search-for-Unity-in-Physical-Law/dp/0465092756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory And the Search for Unity in Physical Law</a>&nbsp;who debunks string theory, but nevertheless seems to accept the idea that if the math contains extra dimensions, reality must also contain those extra dimensions. A mathematical model is just that - a model. It is the best math we can construct at this point in time to describe the reality we are trying to model. It is not the reality itself. If the string theorists are successful in constructing a model that includes six or seven tiny dimensions, that does not mean that those dimensions actually exist. All it means is that the best model we can currently construct has to include those dimensions in the math. Susskind really goes off the deep end with this. We must remember that much more math will come along. Someday, we may have a math that describes the same reality without the additional dimensions. That said, if the string theorists can make a prediction that absolutely, positively depends upon those extra dimensions and if that prediction is confirmed by experimental results, then they may have a case. So far, the string theorists have failed utterly to make such a prediction. Even here, a different math may come along. The night is young.</td></tr><tr><td>Very very good!!! I read every book written by this author..look forward to her next book.</td></tr><tr><td>The next installation of the Lord Uhtred story and in my opinion the best.  There is the usual subplots involving: the pompous hierarchy of the Church and their jealousy for Uhtred; his continuing internal struggle as he tries to mesh his pagan upbringing with the emerging Christianity; his relationship with AEthelflaed; his desire to take back Bebbanburg from his sinister uncle; and where does he fit in the emerging Anglo-Saxon England.  This book  bring new subplots including Uhtred's son becoming a priest and how it clashes greatly with Uhtred's disdain for the Church and the main subplot-Uhtred is getting old.  Cornwell is again the master at interweaving these various subplots into a strong, captivating and thought-provoking story. For those who have read the previous novels about the Uhtred, the main plot in this work revolves around how he deals with his age.  He is still a great warrior and his name still instills fear in the hearts of most men; however, he is a little slower and the younger quicker men cause Uhtred to question his ability.  For those of us over 50, we can relate to the aging signs Uhtred faces.  Well written and exciting \"The Pagan Lord is the best in the Uhtred series.  It is a fun and exciting read.</td></tr><tr><td>I love being taken into another time and place in history. I really connected with the characters in this book and I loved learning the historical and society male view of young virgins and their \"ability\" to CURE men of their STD diseases. It is unfortunate that so many women felt they had no other option for survival but to sell their innocence.</td></tr><tr><td>I won't even go into this story...you have to read it to believe it...I literally laughed out loud...A LOT!!!!  Bonita Faye was delightful.  the way Margaret tells a story is spell binding.  I ran for her other books, only to discover they are not on Kindle...and I hope that is a..YET...I hope they are coming to kindle.  love her writing!</td></tr><tr><td>not finished yet, it is drawn out. Boring</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed reading this book very much. This is a topic that I have grown an intrest in since my husband died two years ago. We had been married fiftythree years and were real soul mates so it was really tough just surviving without him for quite awhile. This book helps to give me hope that maybe he really is still near me and I'm not all alone after all. If you beleive in Mediums I think you will find this book very enjoyable to read.</td></tr><tr><td>The writing style of Anderson Cooper is enough to buy the book. He is no doubt one of the finest journalist that I've come across.  His television show on CNN is outstanding.  Regarding the book, in a word, its depressing!!!  Anderson puts the reader right where he is -- in the middle of devastation.  Event after event, he recounts trauma and human emotion.  If you think you are bad day, then I encourage to open any one of the chapters and your day will suddenly change.  What I don't understand is Why?  Why does Anderson continue to put himself in these situations?  It would have been nice for him to expand on the affects that his findings have had on him.  It's almost as if Anderson could be branded as a robot.  Like I said, the writing is superlative.  He captures the reader from page one. If you are looking for reality and truth of some of mother natures aftermath then I strongly encourage to read this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Thongo risked his life to expose corruption in his country. He also shows us how Western, other foreign countries, and organizations support an nurture corruption under the guise of support and aid to Kenya. It is so blatant that the leaders don't hide their accesses and contempt for whistle blowers. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks corruption happens in Africa by isolation. I will also recommend you read another revealing book -  Confessions of An Economic Hitman.</td></tr><tr><td>Many of the reviews seem to be of women wanting something a bit more casual and \"10 piece wardrobe\" in it's approach to elegance, if so...this is NOT the book for you. Pick another title. The focus and intent of this book is aimed at how to dress semi-to-fully formal from an era were almost every woman wore white gloves as basic clothes and almost nobody (including kids) wore gym shoes outside of a gym. This is not to say the book is \"outdated\" by any means, it's to say that \"What Not To Wear\" type casualness (it's extremely casual compared to the book's focus) is not the goal here. Madame Dariaux's aims can work in the present time for a woman who wants to know how to dress formally or appropriately for more formal occasions (ie weddings, lunches at fancy eateries, parties, and the like) and/or a woman who likes a more \"retro\" style of dress in her daily life. It's full of useful information about garments and accessories that many women no longer wear and subsequently have no idea of how to wear now. If you purchase this book with these things in mind, you won't be at all disappointed or feel it's outdated. Mme Dariaux is NOT coming from a world where \"casual Fridays\" existed. I give this book only 4 stars because of the extremely limited colour schemes suggested....pastels with neutrals as the base. Most women who buy this book will NOT find the pastel palette flattering to them. The palette she gives emphasis (pastel) probably would suit an ashe blonde without much problem, any darker than that and it starts getting iffy. For Black women of almost any shade, the colour scheme will be the least flattering (as an earlier poster mentioned).</td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Chamberlain does not disappoint her readers with this novel. I would not rate is as one of her best, but it was definitely a book worth reading; difficult to put down.</td></tr><tr><td>A really enjoyable read. I found it hard to put down once I started. I didn't want the story to end.</td></tr><tr><td>Wow thus is a great book 2.  I'm not a good review writer so I will say. Must read thus series!</td></tr><tr><td>As the more perceptive reviewers have already noted, this brilliant, charming book paints a superb portrait of the strange, sympathetic, cold Frederick. Years after I've read it, I still remember some of her masterfully chosen details, like Frederick's reaction when asked to approve the execution of a cavalryman convicted of sodomy with his horse: \"you fools, put him in the infantry!\" Many other books will tell you everything and more about the details of Rossbach and Leuthen, but few will give you the impression of having known the man. Lovers of history and biography should read this, and all of Nancy Mitford's other biographies.</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked it, except for the ending.  I hope  there is a sequel to tie up the loose ends.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellence narration and a good glimpse into medieval wars and conflicts.</td></tr><tr><td>Human touches, vast emotional landscapes, alien thoughts, make this book (like Roadside Picnic) a truely original, and inspiring work. I  liked Roadside Picnic better, though. Read these books!!! Also check out Beetle in an Anthill, and the work of Stainslaw Lem.</td></tr><tr><td>Haven't read sure I'll love....love all of Trigiani's books</td></tr><tr><td>Gives a unique view of a millennial perspective on Appalachia.  His story is certainly awe inspiring. Also helps provide some insights into different world views.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a rather large biographical sketch of 40 people who were traveling on United flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco on 9/11/2001.  As most people know, four Arab hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned it around aiming it in the direction of Washington D.C.  The hijackers never made it to their intended target because probably 5-6 passengers decided they were going to take the aircraft back.  The hijackers either lost control of the aircraft or plunged it into the ground. Almost all the passengers were detailed in this book.  Many of them had made last minute phone calls to their loved ones to say good bye, and these were tear jerking moments to read.  That is why I rated this book a four star.  Most of the other material was rather pedestrian. The problem I have with this book is that the author leaves much of the material out about the probable struggle aboard the aircraft.  Perhaps not much is known, but it would have been  interesting knowing the possible scenarios.  What we get is sweet memories from relatives of their lost ones on Flight 93. This should be known, but the struggle needs to more detailed in the book.</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful book! I watched the movie several times in past years, and found the movie to be inspirational. The book is even better!</td></tr><tr><td>I don't really like comparing things, but with this books is just kind of impossible. We have a The Bachelor/The Hunger Games crossover in our hands. The world is divided by castes: from royalties, Ones, to those who have nothing, Eights. America is a Five, struggling to get by, but still pretty happy with here she is in live. She has her music, her boyfriend Aspen, a Six, who she's desperately in love with, and she has no desire to sign up for the Selection or be the queen. That is until Aspen tells her to. Because being part of the Selection comes with financial compensation, and America can't deny that her family needs the money. That Aspen's family needs the money. And that if they ever plan on getting married, they'll need some savings themselves. So she agrees, not knowing that decision would change her life forever. The contest part of the book was nice, but then again, I'm a sucker for those kind of things. The entire story just sort of made me feel like I had read it all before, but I still found myself intrigued by some aspects of it. Like what is Marlee's secret is, what's the reason behinds the attacks to the royals, if America will figure out that Aspen treated her horribly... Maybe that'll prompt me to read the sequel, but I'm not sure.</td></tr><tr><td>Self serving and sometimes confusing account of the first major set piece battle of the Vietnam War.</td></tr><tr><td>I first stumbled upon this book over 20 years ago at the library, and upon finding it used some years later, snapped it up.  I've nearly memorized it and I never fail to find something I missed last time I read it. Until I learned the actual identity of the doctor (Dr. Alan Nourse, renowned juvenile sci-fi writer and longtime health columnist for Good Housekeeping), I wondered if he ever wrote anything else and was thrilled to learn he had.  Upon doing so, I raided the magazine archives at my local library and yes, this book was a huge best-seller (although long out of print, it isn't hard to find) and got a lot of press when it was released. Dr. Nourse died way too soon, in 1992 at age 64.</td></tr><tr><td>Definitely in the top 5 books I've ever read.</td></tr><tr><td>Like the other 4 books that precede this one, it's almost perfect. The characters are great, the plot is interesting, there are twists... the only issue I have is that the main character is unbelievably and inconsistently stupid. He is average or above average in most things, but when it comes to clues seeded into the book, his IQ seems to drop by 50 points. I will give one example, but these books are full of many similar examples: He is spying on a girl. He sees a woman coming and asking the girl to do something. The girl refuses. The woman says that \"the lady will do something bad to your family\". The girl is very scared; her uncle confronts the woman, who leaves them alone for the time being. Now, it's clear the girl is being blackmailed by some powerful woman, whose the above mentioned woman was an agent. Yet the hero is baffled by this; he just files this incident in his memory but does *not* speculate about it. What makes things worse is that in the preceding book, there is a mention of a powerful woman working in opposition to him. I made the connection right away. Why doesn't he see it? It's like he has no ability to connect the dots. This glaring flaw is very frustrating. He should at least consider the connection and then dismiss it with \"let's not jump to conclusions\" or something like that; or the clue should be more subtle. If the reader can make the connection right away and the main character seems unable to do it, despite not really being an idiot in other things, I take it as a major flaw. That said, everything else is great, so I still recommend these books. I just wish the author would realize this problem and fix it in future books to make them perfect.</td></tr><tr><td>But this book is a good reminder that the journey to heaven -or hell- is with us NOW, depending on our willingness to embrace -or curse- that which IS.</td></tr><tr><td>I did not like this book. I did not like it at all. I was expecting it to really cook, but I found it quite banal. It could have been more engaging. Something to sink my teeth in. But it was boring, almost enraging and I don't know where to begin. I did not like this book. Definitely not fun at all. I did not like this book. Id rather stare at a wall.</td></tr><tr><td>Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a glimpse of what an enlightened society might look like. And a good story to boot!</td></tr><tr><td>As far as I'm concerned this is simply the best holiday reading book that I've ever read. Forget about a little chuckle. This is absolute laugh out loud stuff. Bryson is brilliant and when he teams up with his old friend  (enemy) Stephen Katz he's even better than brilliant. This was the first  Bryson book that I bought. I've now read every book he's put out. I think  that's the best recommendation that I can make.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked this book very well.  I think it takes you back to the original Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, in that the \"cures\" are reverse psychology or clear demonstrations, rather than \"magical\" powders and potions.  Being with a loving, confident adult works wonders on the children in the stories.  This is a good book, and it's fun to read aloud. *** update, October 2009 -- used this for a second grade book report -- perfect!</td></tr><tr><td>Get to know the politicians and the Progressives who caused the Great Depression to drag out over fourteen l-o-o-o-o-o-o-n-g-g years.  See how many of them gradually realized that profit is not the enemy, individualism is not a bad thing, and Soviet-style economic controls were a thin facade over tyranny. Notice how Roosevelt considered himself above any Constitutional limits on government interference in private contracts, and the long term impact that had on the private sector. This book is a START at understanding the causes and complications of the Great Depression -- widespread government expansion and attacks on private property and industry.  It especially looks through the lens of the utilities vs. the TVA. Worth a read.</td></tr><tr><td>Yes!  What is not to love about every one of these books?  So so funny and entertaining, love this author!</td></tr><tr><td>Great read.</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting to start off with, his childhood stories are charming and portray a carefree world for children, before the war.  Later the book drags on a little and his initial years in the world of acting are a bit slow, so much so that I didn't go on reading, maybe I'll finish it during the holidays when one wants something light</td></tr><tr><td>He's baack! P.W. Storm, aka Peter Telep, unleashes his Dog for a third and final romp down the rut-filled exit-less freeway of life on mercenary lane. Mad Dog's jumped the pound fence and he's hydrophobic.  Brit-buddy Bippy's shagged with the Dog's gheetas and a fistful of priceless Imperial Green Jade. Take a ride on the Orient Express where Mad Dog and Bippy find out they're not the only explosive duo clickety-clacking between two rails. It's about moolah, jade, diamonds, and nukes!  Okay, it's all about the nukes. The team pulls up help from low places to get away with this one. James Ide, The Nintoku Incident</td></tr><tr><td>my grandchildren really love this series as long as they enjoy it I will get I will buy for them</td></tr><tr><td>I bought both this book and the one called FAMILY COURT HELL through amazon. If you read Divorce Poison first and FAMILY COURT HELL next, you actually see what harm is done to children where one parent tries to poison the childrens minds against the other parent. In FAMILY COURT HELL, a real life child access case that went on for ten years, the mother had spent all those years trying to turn her three little girls against their father. But eventually, the mother instead saw her daughters run away from her to be with the dad they still really loved and missed-the mother ended up losing out, and all through her own fault. Both books excellent reads and a must read for any parent whose ex is trying to turn the kids against them-or an ex thinking of trying to poison the kids minds!.</td></tr><tr><td>Fascinating...enlightening...</td></tr><tr><td>A great fictional retelling of the agonies of Biafra in the late 60's. Great cast of characters, excellent prose</td></tr><tr><td>It was a great book regarding a major storm in history that caused great damage to life and property. Follows different people on land and sea and tells their story. Also has great fact and statistics to help understand it.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great beach read... Not my favorite Marian Keyes, but it was still fun reading with some more serious issues. A bit predictable at times, but still worth reading.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my son to read for school...he hated it. He said he was bored beyond measure and didn't finish the book. In the book's defense: it centers around McDonalds, and we don't eat fast food. We are already aware of how disgusting it is and how bad it is for our bodies so reading a book that brings that subject to light is moot for someone like my son who doesn't like fast food to begin with.</td></tr><tr><td>This was the first book Ive read by Dennis Lehane.  This book had a lot of twists and turns.  Investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro were tasked by their clients to find a woman and some documents she took, but this was not the whole story.  There was a lot left out which will be revealed when you read the book.  A Drink Before the War was the first in the Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro series and I will definitely read the next one!</td></tr><tr><td>Thoroughly enjoyable, this clever book about a crayon revolt was just a plain fun read. Even my teenager laughed all the way through. When poor Duncan decides to color and opens his box of crayons, he finds letters instead. The crayons are tired of being mistreated. The letters are well constructed and the pictures are just perfect. My heart broke a little for poor beige (he's so defeated in his picture ... tired of being called \"light brown\" or \"dark tan\") ... I couldn't get him out of my head even after I finished, I felt just awful for him. And peach! I laughed at him hiding in the box, naked because he'd been used so much his paper was peeled off. Yellow and orange argue about who is the right color for the sun ... and so much more. If you're looking for a just perfect book to teach words and colors to your preschooler, I highly recommend it. It's amusing for parents as well as kids and just so well done.

The village of Sproule is Samantha Northup's world. She has never even been to the next town. In early nineteenth century England, an over-the-hill, unmarried vicar's daughter has limited possibilities when her father dies leaving her penniless and homeless. Even though she is a healer and the people in the village and surrounding community depend on her able, gentle care, the squire's wife says, \"...you're a thorn in our side...\" after an unfortunate incident. The villagers demand she marry the man who put her in an untenable position and he agrees, saying he will take care of her--which relieves the villager of a responsibility of seeing she is respectably housed and fed. Samantha saved his life and finds him irresistible. When he kisses her--her first kiss, it opens a Pandora's Box. He is like a narcotic in her blood. He is her destiny, she is sure. Her naivet leaves her open for heartbreak. Yale Carderock, disinherited son of the now-dead duke of Ayleborough, owes his life to Samantha. He also finds that this stubborn woman, in dowdy clothes and humble in her service to others, is a sensual, hot-blooded woman--a treasure. With her fresh wholesomeness and her quickness to forgive others, she enthralls him. He fully intends to keep his word and to take care of her honorably--he just doesn't plan to take her with him. Plans get derailed when the present duke of Ayleborough, Yale's brother Wayland, arrives in the village. Old hurts, regrets, expectations, guilt, and well-intended lies wreck what had been Samantha and Yale's special relationship. In London, the overwhelming society \"niceties\" in the duke's house have Samantha drowning in the \"do and don't rules\" while she is trying to come to terms with Yale's intentions. He will see her settled and well cared for then he will be off to sea and to his Ceylon business. She tells herself she must learn to live with a broken heart. An amazing secondary character is Fenley, a long-time man-of-service in the Carderock household. He understands Yale, but he sees Samantha's love for Yale and her breaking heart. He tells her \"Love is not something you can cage\". He helps her realize love enriches the spirit giving it meaning and depth. He encourages her to look passed the fears, doubts, hurts, and see love for what it is--bright, pure, and beautiful--a gift. Yale's awakening to what love really is comes when he sees Samantha with his extended family. He breaks a dinner date with the prime minister of England to be at his wife's side. He finds that his forgiving, one-of-a-kind Samantha gives meaning to his life. When his business is dealt a crushing blow and he has to start over, Samantha's love, stubbornness and determination buoy him up. She makes him feel complete and accepted unconditionally. Cathy Maxwell is an awesome story teller. She connects the reader with the characters so the reader feels as if she is sharing emotionally fraught actions and love scenes--so special. She even makes secondary characters seem real. She also works in a touch of whimsy and magic here and there--the green pixie paperweight should not be discounted--just in case. Because of You is spellbinding and memorable--smooth, captivating reading.

My adult guilt for believing in magic and make believe has washed away and I open all of his books with excitement and awe.</td></tr><tr><td>This was more of a technical book. Never the less they explained all the technology in simple east to understand terms. This book was about a microbiotic organism brought back from space. It kills 46 people in one town in a matter of seconds. The story goes on from there. I found it very interesting. Over all it was a great read and I loved it.</td></tr><tr><td>A good read for older teen's and adults due to the violence  started it and finished it in a day. Couldn't put it down</td></tr><tr><td>Fast Shipping . Love this book . i read it many years ago before hallmark released the movie. its an excellent book. highly recommend .</td></tr><tr><td>As a struggling small business owner, this book offered direct insight into how and why I was struggling. It is hard to see all aspects of what you are doing while entrenched in action, so this offering was insightful.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent end to a great series.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the kind of resource book you can refer to repeatedly, as needed.  And, it makes the perfect gift for people of all ages.  Deals with the subject of grief with sensivity and beauty.  A real classic!  Certain similarities to BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY, which is also a story for all ages, dealing with the loss of a pet.</td></tr><tr><td>In my opinion Melville's unique style of pushing the story forward while interspersing it throughout with facts and news/anecdotes from the times is annoying. If you simply isolated the pages that contribute to the story of Ahab chasing after his white whale you would have a 200 page novel that would be 5 stars, however double the book with scrupulous information and it makes for dragging story at times. It is a classic novel and it definitely stirs up a dream of what life was like on the ocean for early settlers in America. I also like the greater lesson about devoting an entire life to chasing after something and the repercussions that can have. Check it out if you have the time and not much else on your book list.</td></tr><tr><td>There are some who consider Howard Zinn an unpatriotic American, but in \"A People's History of the United States,\" he at least proves that he is passionate about the inhabitants of the country. What makes \"A People's History\" so fascinating is that Zinn tells it not from the perspective of the privileged and the connected. He largely ignores great battles, noble speeches, landmark legislation and elections. Instead he shines light on the masses, the mob, the worker and the horde, and I mean that in the most complimentary way. From beginning to end, Zinn refuses to sugarcoat. He gives the greatest possible benefit to the weak and powerless, while putting the powerful in the worst light. The discovery of America is told by discussing the curiosity of the native people toward Columbus, and the brutality with which he returned their gentleness. The era of slavery is covered by telling of white panic in the face of slave resistance and revolts. The building of railroads becomes the tale of Chinese immigrants who were expendable to their white overseers. Zinn demolishes longstanding notions - that blacks were passive in the face of slaveholders; that Americans during World War II were monolithic in their support for the war effort; that historical progress is inevitable. American history for Zinn is the grim forward match of the dispossessed, the poor, the oppressed and abused. Great political events seem less the gracious gifts of beneficent rulers than the reluctant recognition of the \"facts on the ground\" by a laggard political system. Sometimes, Zinn seems to go too far with his approach. Finding dissenters to America's war effort during the 1940s certainly took some doing. Sometimes Zinn spends too much time on a particular subject. The chapters about the labor movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, for instance were long-winded and dreary. Whatever his politics, \"A People's History\" does an admirable job of filling the gaps left in other histories, by bringing into focus the experience of ordinary American men, women and children. It was they, just as much as the politician and the industrialist, who built America, often at the cost of their lives, strength and sanity.</td></tr><tr><td>Who wouldn't want to know what REALLY goes on beyond the smiles and polish at upscale restaurants? \"Waiter Rant\" gives an insider's view of what goes on in the kitchen, and most importantly, what waiters think about YOU. The gamesmanship that goes on inside restaurants is fascinating. Customers trying to get good tables claim to be best friends with the manager. Waiters who get stiffed by patrons log their complaints into the restaurant's computer system. Waiters who tick off management get stuck in weekend day shifts that offer no tips. Managers extort a percentage of tips and dare their staff to do anything about it. Waiters desperately distract customers from the balky air conditioning or the stray cockroach running along a mopboard. Customers snort coke and have sex in bathrooms. The best stories are about lousy customers -- they tip poorly, make exorbitant requests and are rude to the staff. The best story was about a man who had a heart attack in the restaurant. Unbelievably, several customers harassed the paramedics trying to resuscitate the dying man because they were blocking access to a favorite table. \"Waiter Rant\" is a compassionate look at workers who live on the margin -- economically and emotionally. The immigrants who often do the scut work in these establishments are often prey for unscrupulous managers willing to squeeze a poor man by threatening his only job. \"Waiter Rant\" is hilarious, touching and informative. It will open your eyes to the drama behind the scenes the next time you eat in a restaurant. You will never eat in a restaurant. And hopefully, it will make you a better patron.</td></tr><tr><td>Miss Silver is the mentor/guide of the series of books written in the early 50's.  The language was proper and old.  The mores and manners were dated, the former amusing, the latter, adorable. Time for me to move on.</td></tr><tr><td>This is an amazing book.  I am awash in a glow of emotions.  I hate reviews that tell the story, so I'm not going there.  Just read it. I'm giving it to everyone! This is the true unconditional love story.  What do I bring to the table, all the time, with all my relationships? Every day, every detail, no matter what, do I LOVE unconditionally?  When it's not easy, when it is simple, when it is all pain, sadness, loss and when it is all joy, glory, and fame?  Todd says it all:  Be present. Risk. Love. Travel light. It's a gift.  Thank you, Katrina!</td></tr><tr><td>I liked Beastly a lot. It was \"beauty and the beast\" modernized into a capturing read. The book was intricate, and I liked that people could understand the point of view of the characters better, partly because of the modern view and partly because of the personality of the characters. I liked the transformation of the main character, the stereotypical \"perfect rich boy\" into, well, a beast. I liked the girl, too, because of her personality. She was stubborn, smart, shy, and loved to read. The story was well done, though I wish the book had more content and details. I would recommend it to anyone in 8th grade and above. The story was good and the characters were well developed in the seemingly short time we could learn about them, so I give the book five stars.</td></tr><tr><td>Probably one of the best in the series.</td></tr><tr><td>Don't expect the story to be the same as the movie. The elements are there, and the story is a good starting point: but Whybe is not there. The original written story also lacks some emotion. We were always taught \"show, don't tell.\" This story tells Coraline's actions but with almost no emotion behind them. The characters seemed robotic to me except for the other mother. She had feeling and was wonderfully scary. I say buy the book for your collection and for an introduction to the superior movie.</td></tr><tr><td>The Black Tower is a historical mystery set in Paris in the early 1800's. I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction, or \"what-if\" historical fiction, but I found this book pretty entertaining. The protagonist, Hector Carpentier, becomes the unwitting Watson to a dark, mysterious Holmes.  It's not high art, but I found the book fast-paced and quite gripping. It also had some notes of dark humor, giving it the feel of an episode of Law & Order set in 19th century Paris.  It's interesting to note that Vidocq, the mysterious detective, was a historical figure who played a role in the birth of modern criminology. I'd recommend The Black Tower to fans of police procedurals and French history.</td></tr><tr><td>I was a little disappointed in this book. I really struggled to get through the book. I enjoyed the premise from the summary and picked it up but I just couldn't get into it by about the middle of the book. The book started off interesting with April being busted by her dad and waking up next to a stranger. Then we go back in time to see what April did that lead up the events. April stays in California for her senior year while her family moves pretty far away. The circumstances wind up that April is living with her friend and not the adult that she tells her dad. I think what made it harder for me to get through was the flashing back and forth to talk about the past, present and future. April started off as a interesting lead but then took on some unattractive qualities as she obsessed over things and seemed a little flat. I will also say that her slight obsession with sex does get a little old as she has a lot of inner dialogue on the matter. I think these two things together are what disappointed me in the book. I liked the concept of showing the past and starting at the end but it does get a little confusing. So it wasn't the plot that necessarily made it difficult to get through. It was more the characters and the style the book was written in. I didn't really care a lot for the supporting characters either. Usually a book like this has a strong cast of supporting characters to make the story more interesting and I really didn't care for the majority of the characters. I did not like Noah and I did not see the attraction between the two of them or the degree of devotion that Sarah feels for him. Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this book. It wasn't awful but it didn't stick out from the rest of the YA literature either.</td></tr><tr><td>Funny and sad. She lays herself bare for all to see.</td></tr><tr><td>Outstanding!</td></tr><tr><td>Everything she bakes has mace in it-wonder why-I don't think its such a spectacular ingredient but the muffins are tasty and always turn out well-could do with less of her life story though.  It's interesting but long winded.</td></tr><tr><td>Strap on your seat belt and hang on for a wild ride. Very entertaining and heart wrenching. One of his best. Sure be a #1.</td></tr><tr><td>The story doesn't make a lot of sense, and seems like it might be abridged from the one I remember from childhood. Disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book.  Started the second book right away.</td></tr><tr><td>Truly an excellent book with a lot of corrective thinking.  Most of this book is an illustration of how you are already trapped and it's really comprehensive.  There's not a ton in the way of specific advice on how to get out of these traps, but that's kinda the point.  The author never sets out to tell you what to do and how to be successful because he makes the express assumption that he cannot tell you how to be successful because it's different for everyone.  It's informative, not instructional.  That being said, Harry is excellent at showing you the folly in the logic most of us base our lives off of.  If you're the kind of person who sees through the BS, but can't explain it because of how inundated said BS is by nature.  That's what this book is all about and what it gave me.  Clarity of what I already felt in my heart, but couldn't find the words to express.  He applies logic and reason to concepts where logic and reason are specifically discouraged in modern society.  Great book and anyone who struggles with living the grind needs to read this.</td></tr><tr><td>I rushed to buy this book because \"Dreaming of You\" by Lisa Kleypas is one of my all time favorite Romance Novels. And just to see how Derek and Sarah have evolved over the years, in the Kleypas novella, was worth the price. Unfortunately, they are only the parents of the heroine (what was her name?) Oh why couldn't this have been a Derek and Sarah story instead. I hate to say it (boy do I hate to say it) other than the brief moments of Derek and Sarah in the Kleypas story, the rest of the book is a bit....lame. Maybe lame is too strong, but the rest of the stories limp along...ok limp along and lame mean almost the same thing.  Buy \"Dreaming of You\" instead and give yourself a treat. I gave it 3 stars...one for each author...whatever.  Julia Quinn...well maybe she needs a break.  Kinley MacGregor's books are really good, but this story...well let's just say she does better with more pages.</td></tr><tr><td>I've read every one of Daniel Silva's books, and after several books in recent years that weren't up to the level of his earlier stories about Gabriel Allon and team, I think House of Spies was terrific.  Don't start reading this one unless you've got free hours to spare, because you won't be able to put it down.</td></tr><tr><td>It was a nice and romantic comedy book. Made me laugh and cry. So touching. Gabe and Marla were two people I would remember. :)</td></tr><tr><td>This, along with the SBD SuperQuick cookbook, has become a staple in our house. The following recipes are absolute winners: Dutch Apple Pancake (my favorite breakfast food now - does not taste like diet food!) (phase 3) Multigrain Watercress and Cucumber Tea Sandwiches (we often substitute arugula for watercress) (phase 2) Creamy Tex-Mex Bean Dip with Baked Tortilla Chips (great game day snack) (phase 2) Rigatoni with Turkey Sausage and Mozzarella (we add fennel seed and make this almost weekly) (phase 2) Chicken Couscous (lunchtime favorite) (phase 2) Beef and Bean Chili (ridiculously easy) (phase 1) Beef and Bok Choy Fried Rice (BIG favorite) (phase 3) Chipotle Beef Burrito (again, we make this almost weekly) (phase 2) South Beach Macaroni and Cheese (phase 3) Quick Bean Chili (phase 1) Black Bean and Goat Cheese Tostadas (phase 2) Nutty Brownies (phase 3) Flourless Chocolate-Raspberry Cakes (phase 2) Peanut Butter and Jelly Cookies (phase 2) Coconut Wafers (phase 3) The following were okay but didn't wow anybody: Pear Bran Muffins (phase 2) Thai Shrimp Soup with Lime and Cilantro (phase 1) Peppery Cheese Popcorn (phase 2) Warm Steak Sandwich with Roasted Pepper Mayo (phase 2) Mini Cocoa Swirl Cheesecakes (phase 3) And then the following were pretty much failures: Orange Poppy Seed Cupcakes (phase 3) Buttermilk Waffles with Jam (phase 2) Could just be my technique?  But both lacked satisfying flavor and texture in my opinion. On a whole, though, this book has worked fantastically for us and I highly recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>a very nice book--I was surprised at the size--smaller than the usual paperback.  A larger book would be preferable for me,although I have read parts of it and the print is not terribly small.  All in all, a \"dollhouse\"sized volume!</td></tr><tr><td>I love the series and have read them all. My only regret is I have read them all. I now am waiting for more.</td></tr><tr><td>This guy cracks me up, he's had such a crazy colorfull life. Made many mistakes, and has learned from them. This is a must read book, seriously!</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone knows the story, so I'll just say that this is a great hardback edition, appropriate for gift-giving.</td></tr><tr><td>Just as described!</td></tr><tr><td>Posted first on Blog Critics as Book Review: 'Eyes On You' by Kate White. When someone is manufacturing gossip and lies about you behind your back in an effort to discredit you, how do you fight back? What if you don't know who is garnering the damage, and yet your life is changing because of it? In Eyes on You by Kate White, we follow the life of Robin Trainer, a television host, who has fought her way to the top. She has a best-selling book and her show is one of the hottest in the biz. When things begin to go wrong she initially is unsure of what is going on. She quickly catches on though when the more harmless innuendo and gossip turn into more dangerous and possibly deadly games. When the clues point to someone that has to know her well, she no longer knows who to trust. As she tries to put together the pieces before everything she holds dear is lost, she finds that even her life is at stake. Can she find the answers before it is too late? Robin is both beautiful and smart. She is not afraid to walk the talk, but that is exactly what gets her in trouble. White has developed that dreadful darkness that leaves you feeling hollow when you have no idea who to fight against. The challenges and damages that continue to occur put Robin off her stride, and you begin to feel that lost feeling right along with her. How do you stop the constant trickle of trouble that begins to eat away at not just your confidence, but the confidence of those around you? If you enjoy mystery and romance you will find this to be a satisfying read. The darkness is just enough to keep you enthralled and the mystery keeps you guessing to the end. This would be a great book for a reading group, a veritable plethora of information on gossip and its damages. This is a must have summer read and an enjoyable who-dun-it. This book was received through the authors publishing company. All opinions are my own based off my reading and understanding of the material.</td></tr><tr><td>I lost an entire 3-day weekend to this book. A Feast for Crows takes the reader a level deeper than most fiction -- I'm beginning to think this place and these people really exist(ed).  Book 4 adds dimension to the new characters to the point where I've become as much a fan of Davos as I was of Ned Stark.</td></tr><tr><td>An American classic that I re-read from high school.  Everyone should read at least once.  If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.</td></tr><tr><td>Love love Arthur C. Clark.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very short book and very sweet.  Not a lot of words, so very good for young children with small attention spans.  My grandson likes.it.</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps the mother of all romances, this classic crme de la crme Jane Austen story stands as a model that many modern romances seem formulated upon. Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it.</td></tr><tr><td>What a lovely book! So amazing to have first hand accounts of what actually went on and to see just how much the wives of our former Presidents had in influencing their husbands for our nation. They certainly were not the meek and quiet women we consider them to be when we look at their portraits. It's very inspiring.</td></tr><tr><td>I finished the book past 2 am in the morning, fighting sleep to get to the very last page. This was an incredibly satisfying conclusion to an amazingly consistent series.  I was so happy at how all the loose ends tied up and thoroughly enjoyed reading the happily ever after fleshed out by Harrison.  The epilogue was *perfect*.</td></tr><tr><td>Sad, but almost prophetic look of the future for Amerika.</td></tr><tr><td>Fascinating historical review of how our Bible was actually written, copied, copied, edited, edited for hundreds of years. Written by one of the most well known and respected New Testament historians.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a really interesting book about what makes people tick and what determines the decisions that they make. Worth a read.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this book for my 3 year old great granddaughter. Kaydencce Le-ann loves it and we have read it over and over...first I read it to her and then she \"reads\" it back to me. The words and illustrations are great for her age group. I would recommend this book to anyone with young children.</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Winsey, thankfully, began to speak English in later novels, Miss Sayers dropping the annoying patois.  Ingenious as the plot is of this classic early British Whodunit.... Whimsy actually lived on Picadilly...it strained credulity that one villain could accomplish such complex and risky crimes in one day.  And, although the saying is that revenge is best served cold, this revenge was frozen for decades and extreme when executed.  It's difficult to imagine anyone maintaining a level of rage indefinitely.  Just as one might be terrified of something that goes bump in the night for a day or a week, it would seem unlikely that one would remain terrified forever when nothing further happened. A crime of passion is usually just that:  passionate.  Can someone remain in that state indefinitely or would they find their passion waning as time went on? Red herrings abound in this story of a missing banker and a strange, nude dead body found in a bathtub one morning.  It's the type of book that can be read when bedridden and running a fever as, even if you pick it up having missed a page or a chapter, you can easily pick up the thread.  That this should be on the list of all time best mysteries seems a stretch as it appears the plot is simply a vehicle around which to write dialogue that may have seemed witty before World War Two but now seems trite and boring. It would be interesting to bring this plot forward in time, eliminating some of the more unbelievable sequences.</td></tr><tr><td>The concept of the book was interesting but the ending was disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>Terry Pratchett is hilarious. I am not one to usually laugh out loud, especially not when reading, but the Discworld series of books is really funny.</td></tr><tr><td>Great recipes and pictures.  I recognized some family recipes among them, and found some others that look very tempting.</td></tr><tr><td>Another great and useful book by conservative talk show host Dennis Prager.</td></tr><tr><td>The author continues to plot interesting and unexpected scenarios. Very spellbinding and I look forward to reading the next in her series.</td></tr><tr><td>Kept my interest.</td></tr><tr><td>A tale that keeps your interest.  I felt as if I was living the story</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this for my Kindle.  Now I can take Emerson's writing with me anywhere.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved the book.  Enzo became so real to me.  His love for Denny, Zoe, and Eve was so touching.  There were so many wise words and ideas shared.  I especially admired Denny's perseverance. Excellent read!</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent trilogy. This is a can't-put-it-down book. My best friend and I read it together which was great because then we could discuss it and worry about the characters and plot twists together! Check around for Tatiana's cookbook which is rare but you can find it on the rare book sites.</td></tr><tr><td>I wish I could give 3.5 stars. It was more than OK & yet I didn't like it enough to give 4 stars. I'm not thrilled with books that don't end with the last page. No more \"Stay Tuned for the continuation of this story\". Since this seems to be becoming a trend, I'll get the book from my library for now on. There was a lot of action in this story & there was a flow that moved nicely. I don't want to give the story away, but it did manage to grab my attention. James Patterson/Alex Cross fans should be pleased.</td></tr><tr><td>The Elements of Style, or \"Stunk & White,\" has been my favorite book since the early 1980s.  I used it and applied what I learned in all of my writings.  I bought copies of it to give to friends.  I made it as required reading materials the Business Research course I taught in the late 1990s.  I recommend it to any student or writer of the English language.</td></tr><tr><td>Who knew a dog could write such good a story.  A touching story told by a dog from his viewpoint on his life and the people in it.  If you love dogs, you will like this story. While not a heavy, intellectual read, it is a very pleasant one.  As you read through it, it makes you wonder just what your dog would say to you if it could.  Without being the spoiler here, the ending is not at all what you would expect.</td></tr><tr><td>Read it many years ago while in school and liked it immensely, so just had to get it when I saw it listed.  I read it again and liked it every bit as much as I did some 60-years ago.  Most of Kipling's writings are a bit much for me, but this one is very enjoyable.</td></tr><tr><td>Adventure, mystery, love, tragedy, war I would recommend to teens, young adults, and anyone who enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy!</td></tr><tr><td>Nice to have on kindle fire.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this in paperback and was pleased to find a quality hardback at such a good price!  This is a story every young girl should read because of it's timeless messages about respectable behaviors, family devotion and making positive choices.  I love it!</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this book all the way through.  At no point did I lose interest, though I'm not a linguist.  I have always been interested in languages, but there are some dull books out there.  McWhorter's conversational writing style and plentiful personal anecdotes make The Power of Babel a treat.  I always find my interest aroused by comparisons and examples (doesn't everone?), and this book is full of them.  I loved the playful footnotes, too.  In fact, I'm practically a full-fledged John McWhorter fan, and I can't resist a catty comment to the last reviewer: Learn to spell and punctuate before you call the kettle obfuscatory, dear.</td></tr><tr><td>This was a really cute book. My grandson and I enjoyed reading it together. The Pete series is great.</td></tr><tr><td>Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries. Still, I can offer assurance to the hesitant reader that Austen never disappoints. I do wish the pictures appeared in the Kindle edition, instead of merely the captions. I imagine they were wonderful old engravings.</td></tr><tr><td>I know that the age range is 4-8 but with the good reviews I thought that I might be able to use this for my 18 month son who will be 20 months when baby #2 arrives, and we could continue to read it (and we are planning to have a third, so in the future possibly). I think that the illustrations are very nice and the story is okay, but I think that it is better fit for 2.5+ years. NOTE this baby takes a bottle. I prefer  \"My New Baby\" by Rachel Fuller which is better for the age group (1+) and shows breastfeeding. BUT in the end I don't think any of these books are great and I'm making my own. I'm printing out relevant pictures and creating a story with a small blank hardcover book (bought on Amazon for $4) - I think that seeing mommy and daddy with a newborn, as well as pictures of a baby swaddled, crying, bathed, etc. is going to be more realistic and familiar, and better prep.</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing read.  Every word has meaning.  There's no filler words.  Using kindle you can search terms to find his subplot</td></tr><tr><td>Moist von Lipwig has done some wonderful things with the Ankh-Morpork Post Office. However, it bores him which makes him long for his old life as a swindler and con man. Instead of swindling people, Moist has bought a nice set of lock picks and spends his free time attempting to break into the Post Office. His Post Office. Lord Vetinari, not blind to this, summons him to his palace with a new job opportunity.  Knowing that Moist needs a new challenge, he has just the thing in mind: running the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork. The family that runs the mint is not doing a very good job, it costs more than a penny to make a penny. Vetinari sends Moist to meet the chairman of the bank, Topsy Lavish, an elderly woman who keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk and who dotes on her little dog. Before Moist can make a decision about running the bank, it has been decided for him. Topsy passes away and leaves the dog with majority shares in the bank and Moist as guardian of the dog. Therefore, Moist has become chairman. In his new position, Moist starts to make money for the bank, as well as enemies. Making Money, by Terry Pratchett, picks up where Going Postal left off; it's the continuing adventures of Moist von Lipwig and quite a few characters from that novel. Like the previous novel, Making Money takes place in a universe similar to our own, but also populated with vampires, werewolves, many large, ancient creatures made of clay, and other assorted fantastical creations. These creatures provide Pratchett with the flexibility for some very good, hilarious scenes while providing biting commentary on our own foibles, societal norms, and human nature. Pratchett's main point is the gold standard and what constitutes money, which usually isn't fodder for a book of this nature, but then he isn't writing a financial book. This is more about greed, comically attacked and skewered by Pratchett. While the main characters carry over from Going Postal, two secondary characters deserve mention; Mr. Bent, the obsessive bank manager and Cosmo Lavish, a man who comes from the Ankh-Morpork banking family but who also has an unhealthy obsession with Lord Vetinari. The manner in which these two characters are portrayed and used is brilliant. Making Money is a highly entertaining novel; Pratchett's wordplay, plotting, and amazing situations keep the pages turning, the entertainment level high, and the characterizations spot on. Disclosure: Obtained from: Library Payment: Borrowed</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great book but it is abridged.  I thought I was buying the whole book because it was not advertised as abridged on amazon.  This needs to be corrected.  It is not the whole book.</td></tr><tr><td>To label The Velveteen Rabbit as simply a children's book would not do it much justice.  I've read this story many times over and have gotten friends and other family members to enjoy it as well.  I guess I wouldn't have related so much to this story had I not seen it unfold in front of my very eyes for the past 16 years. Teddy, for my sister knew no better names for teddy bears at the time, is a two foot tall pink bunny rabbit my sister got when she was about seven.  At the time, Teddy was sitting on a shelf in a large department store looking out at the hustle and bustle of customers go by.  My sister must've gone by that shelf three or four times before asking a store clerk help her bring it down.  It was at that point that she decided she wasn't going to go home without it.  She clung on to Teddy's neck defensively while approaching mom as if Teddy was body armor she couldn't live without.  \"But you have so many of them already!\" protested my mom.  \"This one is different,\" pouted my sister.  Teddy is cotton-stuffed rabbit, covered with short yarn hairs of dull pink.  She wore a white-turquoise sweater that covered her round bushy tail at the back.  It was my sister's velveteen rabbit.  \"Ok fine,\" mom conceded.  From that day forward, I saw as much of Teddy as I have my sister.  They're inseparable. As the Skin Horse in the book said \"Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in your joints and very shabby.  But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.\"  Teddy too has grown threadbare in places and isn't as fluffy as she used to be.  Her eyes have gotten dull from rubbing and scratching.  Her neck has grown thin and fragile, but my sister loves her all the same if not even more.  To my sister, Teddy was made real a long time ago.  It's only more recently that I've come to realize that Teddy has become part of the family.  My sister was right.  Teddy is different.  Different from all the other toys we've had in the past.  Teddy is real. After reading this book, I realize that love is a journey.  Perhaps not one from make-believe to reality, but from belief to truth.  There are many ways to interpret the lessons from this book.  I have several.  And my take away has been if you truly believe in your love for someone and care about them, then in time it will become the truth that need not be spoken and will last forever.  Applied to life, if you believe so much in something that you are willing to stick it out regardless of what other people think, then it becomes the truth that most people never find in their lives.  If you have a dream, believe in it, work towards it and live it. This is a timeless must-read for any reader.</td></tr><tr><td>I really do not understand the negative reviews. First & foremost this is a work of fiction. You need to have a bit of imagination & give the author a bit of creative license. There was enough real science to carry the sketchy bits & this book had good pacing with a couple of surprises. Loved everything written by Crichton & The Hot Zone by Preston. I think Preston did a fabulous job with whatever was already written by Crichton. This book is Jurassic Park meets Fantastic Voyage with a lot of impossible to believe high tech ideas. Just start with a sample & see if it's your cup of tea. I finished it in under 36 hours. Lost some sleep but it was worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>Very readable and I did enjoy it but it was a little long and in the end, a little predictable</td></tr><tr><td>GREAT!</td></tr><tr><td>I have been hearing about this book for a'm long time now I'm not sure it lived up to the hype but I enjoyed it and look forwards to the rest of the series and the movie</td></tr><tr><td>Wee Free Men is a children's book, but in the great tradition of British children's novels: it can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. For my money, it is Pratchett's finest children's book. In the precocious, ferociously intelligent young witch Tiffany Aching he has created one of the great child protagonists in the genre. In the drinking, thieving, fighting and cussing Nac Mac Feegles, the Pictsies, the wee free men of the title, he has one of the comic forces of nature. The combination will make you laugh out loud. Repeatedly. This 2008 edition brings Stephen Player's illustrations to Pratchett's 2003 novel. In some ways, some of the illustrations are a little too sweet. Tiffany Aching probably isn't that pretty, and I'm completely certain that Nac Mac Feegles are not nearly that clean or cute. But in other ways the illustrations are masterful. Tiffany's \"unsuitable boots\" are perfect. There are four delightful fold-out pages, the flashbacks are styled as diary pages, and the text of signs are set out as signs. The monsters are monsters, just short of terrifying, especially the dromes and the nightmares. And there's even a bit of new material for those of us who have read (and re-read) the book already. The cameos by the Discworld's most famous witches at the end are spot-on. And Player's copy of \"The Fairy Fellers'  Master-Stroke\" is inspired, even if the Feegle is being vulgar. Too often, illustrations added later simply float over the story. Stephen Player's drawings, to a very considerable extent, add to the pleasure of the book. When Tiffany finds the way into Faerie, the fold-out drawing hides and reveals, just as Tiffany struggles to see with First Sight. Player has brought new and additional delight to a delightful book. Very highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>I will read ANYTHING this woman writes - she keeps the story moving with enough twists and turns to hold my interest</td></tr><tr><td>Why I didn't read this glittering jewel of a novel decades ago is a mystery to me.  This was my father's favorite book, so I decided to give it a try on my Kindle.  It is a rich, wonderful, epic and beautifully written story of Buck, a huge,magnificent dog who suffers unbearable hardship, torture and starvation in the Alaskan wild. Buck's spirit and pride are nearly human; his survival had me cheering, and the end of the book left me in tears,  Read it and be enthralled.</td></tr><tr><td>I got this book for free in a Wal-Mart deal when i bought the movie \"Million Dollad baby\". I loved these stories and they are quick reads, sometimes a bit crude but gives a nice show of the inside world of boxing. I would recommend this book for any sport fan and anyone who loves boxing must read this.</td></tr><tr><td>I admire the idea of writing a novel based on your family history, but this book gets too bogged down in everyday detail and is regularly blindsided by love for relatives who were real but make thin two dimensional characters. We all like to think members of our family are wise beyond their years, but NO hormone laden 15 year olds wax poetic on death and bereavement. I honestly didn't find the Ciro character all that sympathetic and virtuous, despite being repeatedly told how morally good he was (enough to steal a woman away on her wedding day!) The old fashioned double standard didn't appeal to me at all - Ciro can engage in casual sex, but Enza had to remain virginal? Sure, that's the way your grandma tells you how her life was, but in reality, Uncle Bastardo has the eyes of her ex boyfriend... Does no one use an editor anymore? I am tired of all the typos and factual mistakes that make it into \"finished\" books. No one called it WW1 until WW2 had happened, and people from Yugoslavia are Balkan, not Baltic (get a map and see!) And yes, I said Yugoslavia, not Croatia or Serbia, as it was a brand spanking new country (and identity) after WW1. Guess what I did there - I used the internet to look up the history, something I wish the author did.</td></tr><tr><td>You can see why he was opposed by the left when he was nominated by President Reagan for the Supreme Court.  His analysis of the disintegration of our culture by radical egalitarianism and radical individualism is well expressed and has come to fruition as he foresaw the future.  A must read to understand why our government is turning its back on the Constitution!</td></tr><tr><td>THREE QUICK POINTS * Point 1: Voyeurism on a whole new level. The entire story unfolds via correspondence such as office emails, forms, IMs, phone messages, lists, and journal entries. Very clever. * Point 2: Where'd the time go? Since the story unfolds via correspondence, it's difficult (if not completely impossible) to track how much time has passed. That also contributes to the disingenuous evolution of Kate and Mitch's relationship. * Point 3: Predictable ending with a nifty twist. This being the type of book that it is, it won't be a surprise that Girl ends up with Prince Charming, but it's the twist at the end that makes it worthwhile. SHORT SYNOPSIS: Boy Meets Girl opens with Kate Mackenzie working on a warning letter for an employee named Ida Lopez, the company's dessert lady, because she sometimes refuses to serve dessert to certain people whom she deems undeserving. These people, of course, find it necessary to complain. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Kate is forced to fire Ida. Ida retaliates by filing a lawsuit. This lawsuit brings Mitch Hertzog, the company's lawyer, into Kate's life and it turns everything upside down and inside out. MY THOUGHTS: This book was infectious. I thought I would pick it up to pass a couple hours, but ended up reading it straight through. First, the fact that this book evolves through correspondence and journal entries was well done and clever. There are so many ways I could have seen such a format crashing and burning, but in this story, it worked. One quirk I did happen to catch, however, is that sometimes individual personalities weren't completely respected. For instance, Kate often clarifies who she's talking about by tacking on a fragmented sentence, such as \"Mitch, I mean\" and as the story continued, I caught other people doing the same thing, even when their previous correspondence wouldn't have suggested that it wasn't one of their idiosyncrasies. It didn't detracted greatly from the story or the reading though. The handling of Ida was beautifully done (until the end). If you're just breezing through the book, it would be easy to miss, but aside from making delectable treats, she's also a bit psychic. The premise of the book hinged on Ida's decisions. Another clever aspect of the book was the recipes sprinkled throughout. I haven't tried any of them yet, but they do look like recipes you can use. My only quarrel was with Ida's ending. I understand why and was glad for her, but I just didn't like the how. But you're probably wondering about the juicy bits, the actual romance that unfolds through the story. What I liked about this particular romance is that it was cute and seemed like a natural unfolding. What made it unnatural, however, was the lack of time transpiring. Love was declared, but it seems odd considering Kate and Mitch could not have known each other very long--or it just seemed as though it was rushed. For the most part, each character was very well drawn. What I found surprising (and pleasantly so) was the depth of evil that dwelled within some of the characters' hearts and that they were rendered without censure onto the page. Kind of like getting to peer in the minds of people when they think no one is looking. On a final note, this book may cause hysterical laughter.</td></tr><tr><td>IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND THE  CAMPS AND WHAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE WENT THROUGH IN THERE LIVES TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. I DO SAY THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK FOR SURE.</td></tr><tr><td>And how thoughtful of him to offer us this book. No Bill O'Reilly, please!!!!!!!! No Rush Limbaugh, you've got to be kidding? No Neal Boortz, you've really got to be kidding? No Sean Hannity, beyond belief. I finally figured it out. Mr. Goldberg has terrible handwriting, his editor is semi-illiterate and there were massive misprints; that must be how 100 good people of good character become the people who are screwing Up America? Probably Mr. Goldberg meant these are the people who are keeping America from being screwed.</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of recipes, but it would have been better if there was a separate book for each type. It would have cost less & been not filled with useless information about other types I didn't need.</td></tr><tr><td>Great for a long trip.</td></tr><tr><td>GREAT PRICE AND A LOT CHEAPER THEN STORE...</td></tr><tr><td>Easy and entertaining to read! Love this series so far! Hopefully the last one doesn't disappoint like all the reviews are saying!</td></tr><tr><td>After witnessing family, friends and co-workers lose weight by \"doing Atkins\", I decided to get the book and give it a try.  I am not a big meat eater by nature.  For a time, I was even a vegatarian, but nonetheless, I am willing to try anything new to see how it effects me. After reading and following the advice in the book for about 10 days now, I can report that I have lost only a few pounds so far (I only need to lose about 15).  Mostly, I notice that my clothes fit better, I have more energy and I never experience those \"blood sugar ups and downs\" that I used to have everyday.. If you are overweight or just curious about alternative nutritional methods, goive this one a try.  The book is easy to read.  I learned a lot about how the digestive system works and how blood sugar is regulated in the body.  In my opinion, it was worth the price just for that understanding alone.</td></tr><tr><td>Read it because of the TV series. Book was WAY better. Love the characters</td></tr><tr><td>The continuing story of the exploits of Aubery and Maturin. A mixture of derring-do, and unrequited romance and high seas. I like the story, however I feel that the fact that there is a series of stories perhaps devalues each individual story.  I also would like to be sure that the action parts are based on some reality - the enthusiasts for the series say that it is, and the writing has  a realistic historical flavour; however the 'top-gallants a lee, bring 'er about, nicely lads' stuff could just as easily be gobbledook for all I know.  As a true son of Erin, I am quite happy with the reversal of usual  stereotype - to have the English partner (Aubery) as a bluff, rash, unreflective type, and the Irish (or Catalan) type as reserved, intellectual, reflective but deadly. p.s. this one also has requited and unrequited long distance love, perhaps to interest the Signoritas.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book of all places in Moscow while on a year abroad in Russia. I did not realize when I packed it that it could have gotten me in trouble there in 1987. I knew nothing about the book when I bought it, only that someone (I forgot who) had recommended it to me and I bought it in a second hand book store in Iowa City at some point in my college life. I read this in about 3 nights. It ensnared me from the first sentence. Ayn Rand became one of my favorite authors. This book is about two architects, one a \"genius\" of his own individual creativity and style, one a genius of collaborative style, and about a woman who is akin to the devil. When I read this book at age 20, I felt like it had extracted my view of the world and society from my brain. It worships godlike talent and condemns the power and mediocrity of the collective. An old friend once dubbed me a fascist for loving this book. It's ideal of \"love\" is rape. A more mature view of the content would find this a disturbing philosophy (compare to servant leadership and \"The Wisdom of Teams\"). Definitely a good read for anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed the book and I'm glad I took the time to read it. I had heard about the movie and I would love to see it</td></tr><tr><td>The book arrived in pristine condition and was delivered before I believed it would arrive. Dr. Seuss books offer a rare form of learning. They include fun! Green Eggs and Ham is a book most of my nieces and nephews have now and it is one that they still like to have read to them quite a lot.</td></tr><tr><td>Take a compelling story - the evil Carl Mays felling the likable Ray Chapman with a pitch - combine it with a brilliant writer, and the result is this book, one of the best-ever baseball reads. Sowell manages to transport the reader back to the period in which the story takes place (1910s and 1920s), while still allowing the tale to play out without clutter or unnecessary writing.  Unlike the many one-dimensional portrayals of Mays included in other works, Sowell paints him as a complex character, a great pitcher who obviously battled some emotional issues.  The death of Chapman doesn't need to be dressed up to be heartbreaking, and Sowell presents the situation in a straightforward manner. From the first page to the end of the book, it's difficult to find fault with anything.  Just a compelling story told by a great writer, this is a book that any fan of baseball should read.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this item for my husband, who loves music.  He really liked this particular one a lot. ( More than I did.)</td></tr><tr><td>I've played classical guitar for over seven years, and this is the book that I have learned the most from. It has a great collection of etudes and pieces to play (Two of my favorites are Se Io M'accorgo and Air) and really good information about the composers.  The explanations are quite good. There are some flaws in this book, though. Some of the left hand fingerings are a bit clumsy. Work through them yourself. Be wary of the metranome times, too. Some of them are way too fast for the type of piece. Play them at a speed that is comfortale for you. Thirdly, write out all of the right hand fingerings (pulmar, index, middle, & anular). If you do it that way, you'll come away from this book with a wonderful repertoire or skills and music.</td></tr><tr><td>Ten Things We Did is a heartbreakingly sad story about a 16 year old girl who is desperately searching for some stability in her life. Her divorced parents have each moved on to new partners and new lives. The main character, April Berman, is angry at her mother's infidelity and her decision to move to Paris, France, taking her younger brother with her. April chooses to stay in her hometown of Westport, Connecticut with her father , close to her friends and boyfriend, Noah. This is why it is particularly devastating for April when her dad announces that he and his new wife are moving to Cleveland, Ohio, halfway through April's junior year. When April discusses her dilemma with her friend, Vi, they come up with a plan that will allow April to remain in Westport. Their situation would seem to be perfect for a couple of teenage girls but ultimately points up the need for parents to be parents and teens to be teens. I found this story heartbreaking because I feel it reflects too accurately the way many parents handle their most important job. They either want to be a friend to their teen or they want to abdicate their responsibilities and allow the teen to make adult decisions that they aren't prepared to make. Unlike many stories of this sort, April is forced to face the consequences of some of her actions, including dealing with an STD. If this book achieves nothing else, it should serve as a warning to parents about following up on what their teens are telling them and about putting teens in situations that they aren't mature enough to handle. There was an abundance of sex, underage drinking, deceiving parents, and profanity in the book. I couldn't decide if the story was supposed to be a lighthearted tale of teen romance or a sadly serious story of a young girl who desperately wanted to feel the love and structure of a stable family.  Overall, this isn't really a book that I would recommend. -Janeth ReadingTeen.net Content: Profanity: Heavy Sexual Content: Heavy Violence: None Other Notables:  Underage Drinking For more details, check out Ten Things We Did on Parentalbookreviews.com</td></tr><tr><td>What can you say about Dr. Seuss, all of his books are great.  Of course everyone has their favorite from childhood.</td></tr><tr><td>These guys are far too cutsey in their writing.it's a big turn off.i am too busy to wade through a lot of silly verbiage. I don't like the book's format and the dopey cartoons. Just give me the facts.</td></tr><tr><td>Unlike many me too books after this, great traders like Paul Tudor Jones, James Rogers etc just told you what you wanted to read (not really tips,  but ways of thinking, thanks to Schwager's intelligent questions) without hard selling how smart and successful they are. It's just one of the best buy in the bookstore (just so affordable the paper back version). However, I must warn you on this: Dont be too carried away by the rosy pictures of these top guns and try to copy a bit from each of them to form your own strategy. Instead, know yourself well and develop your own. Otherwise, you will become the footstool of these market wizards.</td></tr><tr><td>It's okay. Poorly written. It really reveals that the band was just a bunch of losers. I hate that he would tell the story by going back in time, then forward, then back, then forward again, and I couldn't keep up!</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, this book was a little too bland for me. I have read her other books therefor I may be a little jaded.  If you haven't read any other of her books you will really enjoy it. She is a great writer. I thought the \"surprise\" at the end was a little strange. Where did that come from?  I did look forward to getting to read this book however, I didn't race through it like I normally do.</td></tr><tr><td>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>This review is for the Kindle version of The Hobbit: I reviewed this a couple of weeks ago, but I didn't see the review appear here.  That works out for the best, however, because I needed to amend my review.  I read several reviews from others who complained that the Kindle version had issues with portions of the book missing, and I also experienced that about 10% of the way in - whole paragraphs were missing.  I returned it for a refund, but a few days later, I had an idea, purchased the book again, and having read 84% of it at this time, I have had no trouble with missing portions of the book. So what changed?  The first time around, I increased the font size, as it is rather small.  The second time around, I did not, and I have been able to read without problems.  The font size is still a little small for my tastes, and if increasing the font size causes interruption of the book material, that is an issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm still glad to at least know that this might be the problem if it happens again with other books - I suspect it will. The Hobbit is a fun and entertaining book, and you can get much better reviews of the content from other people.  I just wanted to put this out there for others who might be experiencing the frustration of missing portions of the book and to suggest a possible reason/solution.  It is an issue that needs to be dealt with for the Kindle developers, for sure. Good luck and God bless!</td></tr><tr><td>Great condition. Perfect addition to my collection.</td></tr><tr><td>The China-Burma-India Theater was a crucial element of the war against Japan during WWII.  It has been little discussed.  Donovan Webster has done a good job of starting to rectify that. This area has always been of interest to me primarily because my father served in the CBI Theater.  He was never one to talk about his war experiences, but after reading this book, it seems like I have a bit better idea about some of what he may have faced. As with any soldiers serving during wartime, those in the CBI faced numerous difficult conditions including disease, death, injuries, lack of sufficient supplies, etc.  The author helps bring that to life a bit in his treatment of this subject. I would certainly recommend 'The Burma Road' for anyone who is interested in American history, WWII, the military, and particularly those who have had loved ones who served in China-Burma-India during World War II.</td></tr><tr><td>A CLASSIC, FOR EVERYONE !!!!</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a writer myself. Have been an avid reader for more than half a century. I was enchanted by this book, its characters, the imagination of its author, Neil Gaiman. I've never read a Gaiman book before but I'll guarantee you I'll read him again. This book is not only for juveniles or young adults but for anyone who loves a good journey to a place they've never been before. This is much more than a ghost story. It's pure magic. I would recommend it to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>On 14 March 2002, someone who calls herself only \"Amber\" critiqued my 12 March review of Behe's book.  For example, concerning the second error I mentioned in Behe's book, Amber writes that \"I don't know much about this situation\" but nevertheless calls the point I make an \"absurdity.\" Amber thus admits that she has made up her mind without bothering to familiarize herself with the situation.  It is, obviously, impossible to hold an intelligent conversation with anyone whose mind is tightly closed to fact. So I won't attempt to.</td></tr><tr><td>Action packed page turner with terrific character development.  The reader does not have to be a pirate fan in order to appreciate the story...although it does help if the reader knows a little bit about sail boats.</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting story. A reminder of the impact of WW !! on so many lives, on both sides.</td></tr><tr><td>I did not enjoy this book. But who does enjoy a trip into the depths of your own insecurities, inadequacies, inconsequentialness, and your second class status as a female citizen. I think this is really what drove her mad.  A woman with a brilliant mind in a world that both fears and envies an intellectually powerful female is subject to it's constant derision, and it cannot help but eat away at her soul. As my friend would say, \"lived it.\" So no, I did not enjoy this book.</td></tr><tr><td>See, I have this really annoying problem (yes, it's a problem. Others may call it a skill, but trust me, when you have it, it's a problem) where, if I go into something knowing that there's a huge twist in the end, I will introspect every little detail that I normally would have overlooked had I not known there was a twist, leading to me pinning down the twist long before it is revealed, which also leads to my enjoyment in the mystery being lowered significantly. The huge twist in the movie Identity, which seemingly everybody was blind-sighted by? Guessed it in the first two minutes of the movie. Pretty much every single adult murder mystery, which inevitably ends in a twist ending? Pssh, easy; the baby's the rapist. The Madman's Daughter, however, is quite the enigma. I'd gone into The Madman's Daughter knowing that there'd be a twist ending (and for those who have the same problem I have, I'm sorry, but you were bound to find out there's a twist eventually), and while I, in the end, got most of the twist pinned down, how I got to that twist was different than I get to most others. The case with most twist endings is that I come up with at most two theories, and at least one of them slightly resembles the twist at the end. But in the case of The Madman's Daughter, I went through multiple theories as to what the twist was, what the monster was, and the solution to most of the novel's mysteries. And then, when I discarded one theory and thought I'd never see it again, I only ended up bringing it back into play mere percentages later. And even though I did see the major twist coming (mind you, however, only about ten percentages before it was revealed, which is pretty damn impressive for the book), the fact that I saw the twist coming didn't impact my enjoyment in the novel in the slightest, unlike most cases. Sheperd incorporated each and every twist into The Madman's Daughter with such finesse and cleverness that each twist was enchanting, and I was able to look over the fact that I had saw them coming and just turn the pages in awe as I had come to realization of how Sherperd had woven the twists into the story. And speaking of the story, what a story it was! The Madman's Daughter opens with a bang, and ends with an even bigger bang, full of complete and utter brilliance at every corner. The middle, however, is where I feel the novel met its faults. While much of the middle section of The Madman's Daughter is filled with suspense, intrigue, and secrets, much of it is also filled with relationship angst, something I am definitely not a fan of. And while I wasn't completely sold on either of the romances in The Madman's Daughter, which is probably why reading about Juliet go on about either of the boys was a bore to me, I definitely appreciate and almost admire how Sherperd made the love triangle play out. Juliet was an absolutely amazing character, and I found myself loving her very soon in the novel. She's smart, sassy, strong, and while she is a bit sidetracked by the boys at times, I found her to be an amazing heroine and protagonist to follow around, and her sparkling wit and how she dealt with the misogyny of her father was amazing. The character of Juliet's father, Doctor Henri Moreau, was also one that was well developed, and he was a character I found myself loving to hate. The two love interests of Juliet, however, like I had mentioned earlier, never really sparked much of a reaction from me, and my opinion on both of them are pretty lukewarm, but they, too, are met with a good deal of character development throughout the novel. Chocked full of suspense, interesting and clever plot twists, creepy-crawlies, great side-characters, and truly disturbing and horrifying moments, The Madman's Daughter will surely appeal to any horror fans looking for a chilling read. I'm not entirely sure where the story could go from the ending of The Madman's Daughter forward, but either way, I thoroughly look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy and seeing what else Megan Sheperd has in store.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is such an awesome reminder of natures beauty,and how we all can contribute to protecting even the smallest living thing! This little girl saves a flower,and with the support of her father and then her mother she goes on to create an awesome backyard full of juicy aliveness! My four yr. old loves this book and so do I. A very heartwarming journey I highly recommend it. I always have a happy sigh after reading it.</td></tr><tr><td>not so good</td></tr><tr><td>Another favorite baby book. My grandkids loved it so I bought it as a gift</td></tr><tr><td>I have read approximately 20 books about Lincoln and the Civil War era and can recommend this one very highly.  It is well researched and referenced but the best feature is the linear narrative and writing style which is very reader friendly.  It is a history book but is not written for historians only and I found it hard to put down even though I was aware of all the coming events.  The treatment of Mary Lincoln was fair and accurate and the picture of \"Lincoln's Generals\" was both frustrating and vivid, generating new respect for Grant and Sherman.  One does not need to have a history background to enjoy this book and I recommend it to those who are digging into the Civil War era for the first time as well as those who are already well versed in the period.  The references are voluminous and are unobtrusively placed at the end rather than footnoted or numbered in such a way as to interrupt with the flow of the narrative.  Enjoy.  I certainly did.</td></tr><tr><td>While this is definitely a good book at times it had a bit too much violence for my taste. The author did a commendable job on researching the history.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the best book to read for people who want to start into the world of computer networks, but may not come from a computer science background.  If you've got a good background in CS, or are already familiar with computer/math theory, go get Andrew Tanenbaum's 'Computer Networks', as Comers book will probably not hold enough technical details for you. This book does not require much rigorous/mathematical thinking to read through and gives a great introduction to many networking topics. (a quick example of this is how Comer mentions the CRC computing techniques only to a certain, friendly level while Tanenbaum's book jumps right into the explicit details of doing the computations by hand!!!) In his over-all progression from the physical, data transmitting wires of a network to software application's that use networks, Comer covers a good chunk of what networks are and how they work without losing you in detail's involving lot's of 0's and 1's. :) And if after reading this book you're still hungry for more knowledge on what you'll then know to be Computer Networks, then go read Tanenbaum's book.</td></tr><tr><td>Inspirational. A great High School reading assignment. I hear PBS did a film about this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Dallas Willard desires the ethical teachings of Jesus to be taught to the nations so that social policy may be shaped and individuals conformed accordingly.  Willard acknowledges that the Christian faith is currently out of favor with the world's power brokers as well as with the post-modern man on the street. He therefore tries to reposition Christianity as a verifiable \"body of knowledge\" as opposed to mere belief. But Willard's 20 pages of argument that God exists, 10 pages of argument that God miraculously intervenes in the affairs of men, and five pages of evidence for the Resurrection will hardly convince the skeptical, post-modern world that Christianity has now been verified. As an alternative appeal, Willard creates a synthesis between Christianity and the post-Christian worldview with his concept of \"Christian Pluralism.\"  Here his message is that the Jesus described in the Bible is not the one whom the world needs to know, but rather, it is the \"Cosmic Christ\" who brings tidings that love is all you need. Willard equates the Cosmic Christ with \"agape love\" and proclaims that \"it's all about agape love.\" (pp. 154, 187.) Willard states that eternal salvation is ascribed \"exclusively to the Cosmic Christ, the eternal Logos.\" (p. 187.) Where the Bible appears to attribute salvation to the historical Jesus, Willard says this is only a temporal deliverance from physical afflictions such as lameness. (p. 187.)  According to Willard, \"the Cosmic Christ is a light that enlightens everyone\" and it is only through the Cosmic Christ by which a person comes to God. (p. 177, 187.)  Indeed, a person who practices \"agape love\" can come to God through the Cosmic Christ, and be accepted by God, even if they have never heard of or believed in the historical Jesus of the Bible. (p. 184.) By ascribing to the Cosmic Christ alone the power to grant eternal salvation and to reconcile men to God, Willard elevates this \"Christ\" above the historical Jesus described in the Scriptures.  Consequently, when he says that \"the one we call 'Jesus' is also the Cosmic Christ\" (p. 177), we are left to wonder what he actually means by the words \"Jesus\" and \"Christ.\" Francis Schaeffer's admonition in his book Escape from Reason is needed now more than ever: \"I have come to the point where, when I hear the word 'Jesus'-which means so much to me because of the Person of the historic Jesus and His work-I listen carefully because I have with sorrow become more afraid of the word 'Jesus' than almost any other word in the modern world. The word is used as a contentless banner, and our generation is invited to follow it. But there is no rational, scriptural content by which to test it, and thus the word is being used to teach the very opposite things from those which Jesus taught. .... We have come to this fearsome place where the word 'Jesus' has become the enemy of the Person Jesus, and the enemy of what Jesus taught. We must fear this contentless banner of the word 'Jesus' not because we do not love Jesus, but because we do love Him. We must fight this contentless banner, with its deep motivations, rooted in the memories of the race, which is being used for the purpose of sociological form and control. We must teach our spiritual children to do the same.\" <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Escape-from-Reason-A-Penetrating-Analysis-of-Trends-in-Modern-Thoughts-Ivp-Classics/dp/0830834052/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Escape from Reason: A Penetrating Analysis of Trends in Modern Thoughts (Ivp Classics)</a></td></tr><tr><td>I have always admired Sela Ward for her beauty., work as an actress and the fact  that she is a Chi Omega.

Boought for a baby shower.</td></tr><tr><td>Using this as textbook in education class.</td></tr><tr><td>This novel, by Tracy Chevalier, is a fictional story about the young lady in the famous Vermeer painting from the mid 17th century.  There are just a few facts known about his life, and nobody knows who the girl actually was, but the author did the best she could to stay true to the world of Vermeer and the Dutch masters of the time.  She obviously did extensive research into his art, as well as daily life in Holland at that time.  The result is this small gem of a book. The writing is simple, told in first person narrative, by Griet, who, at 16 years old, became a maid in Vermeer's household.  Life in the 17th century comes alive as she describes the details of her daily tasks as well as the tensions between the various people living in the house.  The writer uses excellent character tags and paces the books so the reader just wants to keep turning pages.  Along the way, we learn about art and the specific techniques that the painter used for mixing colors. It is a nice story and everything falls into place. Griet is wide eyed and innocent but just a little too perfect for my taste, however.  The other characters seem to have more depth. Vermeer is the most complex.  And so is the butcher's son who courts Griet with blood under his fingernails as well as Griet's brother who is apprenticed to a Delft tile maker.  Sometimes it felt like I was reading a romance novel based on just a few scanty facts and I was annoyed at those times, well aware that what I was reading was not necessarily the truth, but just a figment of the author's imagination.  At other times I felt I was right there in Vermeer's studio, noticing how the light caught the face of his subjects, sensing the smell of linseed oil and viewing the world through the painter's eyes. I cannot make the book what it is not however, and do applaud the author for bringing this work of art to the public by means of this novel.</td></tr><tr><td>Why read anything other than \"previous expeditions have failed\" books?</td></tr><tr><td>Great book.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this book!  The tale of Cinderella has been told in a surprising new way.  It is a deviation from the usual fairy tale in the way that there's a twist here and there, and a surprise at the end.  I found the story riveting and couldn't put it down.</td></tr><tr><td>Save yourself. The pacing is wretched. The names are hard to follow, too</td></tr><tr><td>This book was at the top of my AlexLit recommendation list, and I have to admit that Hypatia hit a home run with this book. It took me a long time to finish, mostly due to never being able to give it all of my attention, instead having to catch a chapter here and there when I could amongst all the moving plans, preparations, and actual occurrence. While reading it, I could not help myself from remarking to several people how it was the best science fiction book I had read in 10 years. The book is two stories: the first is that of Jan O'Deigh, a reference librarian at a branch in New York City who finds herself caught up by Franklin Todd in discovering just who is this mysterious Dr. Stuart Ressler, whom Todd works with on the graveyard shift for a computer processing firm. The other story is that of Stuart Ressler, a young PhD who sets out in 1957 to crack the genetic code and falls in love with a member of his research team. The two stories are quickly revealed as love stories--but not just sexual love between the two couples, but an extended love of discovery, of knowledge, and of friendship. \"Science Fiction?\" you ask. This sounds like one of those mainstream literature books that's all about adultery and real life. It all depends on how you define science fiction. I've been accused by Jill that I'm the worst hypocrite when it comes to defining science fiction by limited it to what I like. For example, I despise David Brin's The Postman so much that I refuse to call it science fiction. To me, The Postman is a warmed over western, and not even a very good western at that. I was not surprised that Kevin Costner wanted to film that book--its politically jingoistic nature and focus on the strong individual overcoming all was just the kind of role that he would have written for himself, and often does. The background to The Postman may imply science fiction for those who let anything about a possible future be defined as such, but I maintain that science fiction is fiction that contains a strong element of science to it. The Postman is a fantasy, albeit [1] a depressing, end-of-the-world sort. Which brings me back to the book at hand, which is so consumed with science that it nearly overloads the reader. The Gold Bug Variations is not set in the future, though, and that's why most people would question its SF credentials. Instead, it is set in the most recent past--the present of when it was published. A reader that comes to The Gold Bug Variations without a scientific back- ground, or at least some basic knowledge of genetics, will soon find themselves drowning within the terms that infuse the book, but it works because the viewpoint character is a reference librarian who has fallen deeply for a geneticist. There are constant references to cracking the code of the central mystery, items occurring in genus and phyla. Even beyond my personal definition of science fiction, it even matches that broader definition of SF as fiction about worlds that are not. In the end of this book, an action occurs using ATM and other financial devices that did not occur (and I question whether it could ever have occurred) in our world. For the book at hand, it is believable, a strong evidence for a writer creating a self- consistent world-view. This is all beside the point that I really want to make, and that this is simply the best book I've read since I finished A.S. Byatt's Possession, discussed long ago in Installment #7, I think. I still remember the thrill of ending Byatt's novel, of the hair of my arms sticking up in a static reaction because of how everything in the book just came out \"right.\" How I kept reading slower and slower, trying to make Byatt's world last just a moment longer, trying to delay arriving at that last word. Powers' novel affected me differently, but just as powerfully. I picked it up one night around 8pm. I was around page 400, I recall, and started reading, and kept reading, and continued reading. I knew it was getting late, but I could not stop; I needed to finish this book. I was propped up in bed, Jill fast asleep beside me as I sped through the pages. I had to know what happened to these people. As the end got nearer and nearer, tears rolled down my cheeks. I had gotten to know these people so well in 600+ pages that I was entirely sympathetic to their agony and joy. That's powerful stuff, folk. I can not recommend this book too highly. It shares a lot of my feelings about literature--that it can be intellectually rewarding and emotive at the same time, that it need not be an adventure to be engaging, that it be about individuals and about the world. I need to find out if Powers' other novels achieve this same intensity, but I guess it will have to wait until I have the time to read the rest of Byatt's oeuvre as well.</td></tr><tr><td>This story is a classic for a reason.  It's an easy read and is very cute and endearing.  Good for all ages.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the nexted book I read after the book before this \"The Hobbit.\" To me it still had the adventure I've always wanted to read in fairy tales. I'll just tell you about the book just alittle to see if you would like to read this book. Bilbo has aged over the years since the last book. He's the towns hero ever since his mysterious disappearance and his remarkable return. He has brought alot of gold so he doesnt have to do anything and worry about anything. But since then people have bugged him and taking all his stuff! And people don't respect him as much. So when its time to leave he passes on his magical ring and all of his things to his cousin and heir Frodo. Then one of Bilbo's best friend the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to becareful because the ring has strong powers more powerful then he can imagine. So it is his turn to have the adventure. And he too will have hardships but will he have sucess? or will he perish? Thats your job to read the book and find out!</td></tr><tr><td>This book was everything it was said to be. General Franks voice just comes out shooting straight and gave me a good look at the plans of the wars, the behind the scenes conversations that took place. Also interweaved through out the book is the life of General Franks from a small boy to the General he is today. You can not go wrong with this book.</td></tr><tr><td>book itself is good. but the Kindle app on iPad is showing the contents in such small font size they hurting eyes</td></tr><tr><td>This is a completely fascinating book, well-written and completely enjoyable.  The story is amazing and very troubling, well-documented and essential to understanding how America has evolved to today's sad and scary reality.  Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>Never been a big Hunter S. fan but I was talking to a friend the other day and we both lamented the lack of decent writing on current issues hese days. So- I picked up Fear and Loathing and although of course I wouldn't call it pulitzer material, at least there was some good writing, wit and social oI know gave their  original copies to the used book store years ago.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book</td></tr><tr><td>There are so many deep philosophical ideas played out in The Alchemists. I have often thought that we are lead by an unseen hand.  I consider myself a rational person but there have been many times when I've allowed destiny to lead the way. Mr. Coelho tells the simple story if a shepherd boy who travels far and has many adventures only to return home where he finds his fortune.</td></tr><tr><td>as it advertised</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book aloud for my tween sons.  Like the other books in the series, it has many illustrations and short chapters -- ideal for struggling readers or short read-aloud sessions. The whole series is pretty preposterous, and it's part of the fun.  But this particular book seemed a little too ridiculous -- like a stewardess telling Stanley it's not safe for him to fly in the seat pocket and instead sending him to the cargo compartment.  Like that's safer? My kids and I agreed that this adventure is not the best of the series.</td></tr><tr><td>I have used this book on several occasions to introduce friends and family to Vonnegut.  In this fast and easy read, you have all of Vonnegut's strengths, all the elements of his masterpieces (Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle, etc.) in one amazing novel.  It is hilarious and ridiculous at times (he illustrates the novel himself with hand-drawn pictures of underpants and wide-open beavers), but always there is the genuine love for human beings and the deep feelings of hope and loss which Vonnegut and his fellow WW2 soldier/writer Joseph Heller are famous for.   Read this book as an introduction to his other works.  If you've already read some of Vonnegut's works, you can find all the threads of his philosophy come together here.  Make it the beginning and the end to a Vonnegut study-- die-hard fans, read it again!  You will discover something new to enjoy every time you read it.   Ah, and this is one of those situations where the film adaptation should NOT be substituted for the real thing, nor should you judge the book by the horrid movie of the same name.</td></tr><tr><td>Joanne Harris is an erudite author who presents this story with utmost care in a clever plot. When I first began the book, I believed I was reading a nice old English boy's public school mystery but then she took the reader from the traditional setting and laced it with technology of e-mail and computers.  The antagonist could play both parts in both worlds.  Some of the irony was unrealistic but it is good fiction and the characterization of the father was enlightening.  At the end we can see a sharp dichotomy of the child Snyde's father and mother and how they treated their only child.  Ms. Harris tied the plot up at the end, but the fate of Xavier was a bit outlandish.  I did enjoy the book and would continue reading her work.</td></tr><tr><td>I hoped this was the special edition of the book with pages for the child to fill in at the back. It is not. I picked up the special edition at Target, and can't seem to find any more of that special edition, online or otherwise. The story is all Seuss, of course, so it's fun and engaging for kids, though it might not be particularly for preschoolers because of the vocab.</td></tr><tr><td>I like it</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow, the main character, is a likeable fellow. He is a model of a good-at-heart kind of a guy with his own sins or shortcomings to live. His surreptitious quest moves along pretty swiftly. Furthermore, Mr. Gaiman, the ultimate creator of amazing characters, is very perceptive of area slang all across the United States - at least, the route that Shadow trudges - and he amicably brings them alive on paper in compelling dialogues. His tale is a mixture of fantasy, myth, science fiction, love story, mystery, action, and comedy. All burning questions are duly answered at the end of the novel. Mr. Gaiman's brilliance and phenomenal inventiveness has resulted in a book that is a page-turner from the beginning until the end.</td></tr><tr><td>I hate having to give only three stars for this pleasant but rather adolescent read.  It would be a lovely read for a younger reader than I but I was expecting more.  I understand Michael Morpurgo is better known for writing chnildren's books so perhaps that influence comes through clearly in this new approach.  Having said that I must say I did enjoy the book, I liked the simplicity, the emotion, the sensitivity and the insight into the awfullness of war as depicted in this lovely story of a horse and his many owners.  It takes us from his early days, and beguilingly it is told in his own words - it is the horse who is telling his own story - on a farm, the relationship he enjoyed with his young owner and moves on from there to his rather abrupt removal from his idyllic life to his training to become a war horse.  Then it moves on to the reality of life in a war zone.  It gives a fine insight into the realities of that ordeal as well as exploring the humanity or man in dreadful conditions and sadly, the inhumanity of man too.  I would recommend it for younger readers - just a tad too Disneyland for me particularly the accidental meet of a dear friend.  I will not say any more in case I spoil it.  Enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>Classic novel.  Love this book. I will read again once my son is done with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Third in the Bonner family series, following INTO THE WILDERNESS AND DAWN ON A DISTANT SHORE, this latest installment in Ms. Donati's historical saga lives up to reader's high expectations following the first two novels.  Set in the early 1800's in Northwestern New York State, Lake in the Clouds is the Bonner's family settlement.  Near the fictitious village of Paradise, west of Albany, Nathaniel Bonner, his second wife Elizabeth, and their eight-year-old twins Lily and Daniel, struggle to maintain their principles of equality amidst a world of hatred and prejudice.  Nathaniel's daughter Hannah, from his first marriage, is half Mohawk and half white and has apprenticed under the local physician, Dr. Richard Todd.  As Hannah journeys to New York City to learn the practice of administering the small pox vaccination, Nathaniel and Elizabeth must deal with a complication of their own.   A fugitive slave woman is discovered on Lake in the Clouds, and freed slaves and friends of the Bonners, Curiosity and Galileo Freeman , ask for the Bonners' help.  Though their family may be at peril, the Bonners along with Hannah's aunt and uncle, Many- Doves and Runs-from-Bears, must decide what action to take next when a bounty hunter and childhood friend of Hannah's appears in Paradise.   Rich historical detail enhances this novel, thereby creating realism that adds power to a story line involving the almost insurmountable obstacles faced by early American settlers.  Though romance is found in the ever-changing relationship between Nathaniel and Elizabeth Bonner, Ms. Donati's latest unveiling of the early nineteenth century world dispels notions of romanticism of the times.  With a multitude of life-threatening illness and lack of medical care, life on the frontier and in the cities was filled with peril.  But the enduring quality of this captivating tale lies in the strength of its characters, as they must face each new challenge with a reliance on friends and self that is not often found in today's world.</td></tr><tr><td>Fantastic recipes!</td></tr><tr><td>Works and reads very well on my Kindle Fire. War was a very different things when this was written. Has a lot of good advice on all manner of subject besides war</td></tr><tr><td>Found it very interesting, even in the end. I wouldn't recommend Insurgent though</td></tr><tr><td>I, too, am desperately seeking a copy of this book. I read it when I was in high school, and it really turned me on to reading. It was the first time I realized that reading could take you away, provide an escape from reality.  It meant so much to me. I read that book 5 or six times - it was totally dog eared and worn.  Now, 20 years later, I  still think about it... and I can't find this book anywhere.  Reading this story was like stepping back in time - into a romantic and  charming and exciting time... I really wish the publisher would re print  this book!  I would love to have my daughters read it now. Why can't they get it onto Kindle - certainly it could be done inexpensively.  And it is a timeless tale - never will be \"out of date.\" I'm not above begging, here...</td></tr><tr><td>Awesome subject matter:  how 'old fashioned' gods traveled to, and attempt to survive, in modern America. Great twist at the end of the story that I didn't see coming, and that was a really great sum up of the entire point of the novel. But, too little too late for me.  I just found the pacing and choices made in this novel not to my taste.  Gaiman is a wonderful storyteller with an incredible imagination, but the style with which he wrote this book was much too slow paced for me. There was too much page space devoted to things I didn't find quite as interesting.  Stories on how gods came to America and how they lived in modern times were a few pages at most, and sometimes only a few confusing paragraphs.  This was the subject that most interested me;  the gods, ancient and modern, and their lives.  Mostly, this story is devoted to the travels of Shadow, a man recently released from prison who's wife died while he was in.  The problem with this for me was that this character is approched with the same emotion for the death of his wife, or supernatural events, with all the emotion that he uses while walking down the street, or playing checkers.  That is to say, none.  He handles severe trauma and the severe supernatural as if it is something witnessed every day.  There is no character developement of him, either.  What you see is what you get through the entire book. At the end, I was left wondering exactly what the point of the whole thing was... which, in retrospect, might have been the point to the entire book. Not a bad novel by any means;  enough of my friends have loved it.  But simply not one to my tastes at all.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book for the second time after my first reading two years ago. This time my focus was to see if the principles guiding \"visionary companies\" (most of them old economy models) will hold well in the new  economy.  I am convinced that most of the visionary companies would succeed  in any kind of transformation in the marketplace. It is these companies  that set \"BHAGs\", have excellent cultures, care for their image  and emerge as stars in the final analysis. Good  management principles  cannot be discarded for the sake of temporary gain. And that is precisely  why these companies have survived in turbulent times in their making . This  is not to say that all 18 companies would repeat their performance for the  next 50 years; but if they continue to be guided by the same fundamental  principles on which they are built , they will certainly last forever. Dot coms may kindly note....</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good book but not one of her best, but once I got into the story I stayed up very late (or very early in the morning) to finish the book. I prefer the Rosato & DiNunzio books more than this standalone.</td></tr><tr><td>It is The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams Bianco. If you haven't read it to your children then shame on you.</td></tr><tr><td>\"The Other Boleyn Girl\" is a soaped up version of history. If you enjoy soapy drama, you may like \"Boleyn Girl.\" If it is not your thing then you probably will not. I went into this knowing it would be soapy, and the first half of the book is tolerable in its suds. However, as the book goes on parts of it became overdone. When a tear falls off Mary's cheek and lands on her lover's hand. When he kisses it off she goes \"Why? Why did you do that? Why did you kiss the tear off my hand?\" The book also isn't big into things like character development, and the second half, which gives Mary a new love interest, greatly lost my attention. The author also fails in her attempts to build Mary up as a strong character -- once she meets her future husband, she loses all her backbone, and always does exactly what he says. I listened to the audiobook, and by the end I just wanted to be finished so I could listen to something else.</td></tr><tr><td>Doug writes a Soap. That's it. A vile Soap Opera! Absolute Drivel... Suspicious: has Douglas Coupland actually written this or has he become this generation's Victoria Holt?</td></tr><tr><td>The books based on a pretty sizeable coincidence, but Christies deft plot handling saves it from being too hard to believe. Farewell, Miss Marple.  You were pink and sweet and fluffy to the end.</td></tr><tr><td>A great book documenting the patriotic drive of an America long past.  These Patriots from \"fly over country\" gave of themselves and of their rations to provide America's servicemen & women a \"touch of home\" on their continent cross-country. For many unfortunately, a single experience. Of the minions who passed through North Platte, NE all remember the experience fondly.  My 90+ year old brother recommended the book, and gets a bit \"thick voiced\" when he mentions the experience.  He passed through 3 times  and final time after the war, when the \"Canteen\" remained open to welcome \"our boys\" home. A must read if you have interest of an era when patriotism was a national attitude; as opposed to the contemporary ethos.</td></tr><tr><td>Reading this book to my kids and brings back so many terrific memories.</td></tr><tr><td>Love Tony Hillerman.  I have spent a bit of time in the AZ and NM area and can just \"see\" the places he is writing about!</td></tr><tr><td>Jean Craighead George with paintings by Wendell Minor educates the reader in the history and evolution of what are known as the Galapagos Tortoises. From the time after the dinosaurs roamed the earth to Lonesome George living out his final days at the Charles Darwin Research station on Santa Cruz Island, the reader learns about these magnificent mammals. At the end of the story, the reader will find two pages of key terms, resources and a timeline that could be used for further research into the George Tortoises or as a jumping off point for a classroom or home-school project.</td></tr><tr><td>Though this could have easily fallen into the \"oh, poor me\" genre of books, The Leisure Seeker redeems my faith in the ability of hitting a life experience head on and living what time you have left right between the eyes . Yeah for John and Ella Robina, both in their eighties and both with end of life illnesses.  After being married for more than fifty years Ella has decided to end her cancer treatments, her horserace soliloquy is hysterical, and John has Alzheimer's.  Ella decides that they need one more adventure, one more chance to be alive before they die, so she packs up the RV (a Leisure Seeker) and they head from Michigan to California.  Their goal is to drive Route 66, remember their lives, and end up at Disneyland, the happiest place on earth. Against their adult children's wishes they kidnap themselves and head out.  John still remembers how to drive and Ella is darn handy with a map, as long as her difficult periods can be contained by pain medication. And adventure they have, often laugh out loud funny, these two \"down-on-their-luck geezers\" take on what most would be too terrified to do.  With humor, though sometimes darker then you would expect, and a whole lot of gusto, this dynamic duo take on the ride of their lives. To say that the end is an OMG moment is an understatement.  I love this couple and the life lessons that they have taught me along the way.  I just wish that when I am this age I have the courage to be Ella and have the adventure of my life.</td></tr><tr><td>If you enjoy crime/murder/suspense you will definitely enjoy the hard to put down Prey series!</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to read. Entertaining. Will definitely read book two.  A classic lover's triangle but I'm not sure who to root for</td></tr><tr><td>What can I say?  Another great book from Kelley Armstrong. Although this time this book is aimed at young adults, it still has all the excitement of the WOMEN OF THE OTHERWORLD series.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves Kelley Armstrong's books.  If you're new to her works, I would recommend reading the whole trilogy...1 THE SUMMONING, 2 THE AWAKENING 3THE RECKONING.  Although there are plenty of books out there where you don't necessarily have to read the series from the start to understand what's going on, but I think you won't be disappointed with reading this whole trilogy.</td></tr><tr><td>Of all the stories in \"The Lord of the Rings\", this one is the most enjoyable. It's lighthearted, energetic, and enchanting. If you want to see good fantasy, read this book. See more at [...]</td></tr><tr><td>I agree with those who say that this is the best book out of the four. It's definitely the most complex, and has the most character development. Mark, who was an abused child long before that became a catch-phrase, is sketched out wonderfully. Oren's sister, who he mentioned early on, must have been a good influence on him, because he's resilient, kind and intelligent, despite what he has to put up with from Oren. I agree with Rush when he said the Melendys were the lucky ones, to get Mark for a brother! Although I did think Rush was pretty rude, barging in every day while the girls were canning, and demanding to be fed immediately! Did he think that just because Mona and Randy didn't have a five-course meal ready and waiting, that they were going to let the guys starve? And it's not like they'd been doing nothing! God bless Mr. Titus for helping them out! My favorite bits were when Rush and Mark spy on Oren and his pals at the still---that was real adult talk, but still appropriate for a kids' book: not easy to bring off---and the auction and fair. I loved when the Delacey brothers showed up and bid on the boar. \"The three of them should be very happy together\"---good one, Willy! And I felt so bad for Oliver when he fell down the well! That was a good device, too. For so long, he'd gotten so little attention because he didn't demand any, and look what finally happened. It forced the other kids to realize how much they cared about him, and show it, and they handled it themselves, showing how capable they were. Good for them! And I also liked when Cuffy was leaving to visit her cousin and had to cram weeks worth of nagging into an hour. \"Close the windows whenever it rains! (Duh!) Call me long distance if anything goes wrong! (And that will help, how?) Don't forget to feed the DOGS! (Like they'd let you!)\"</td></tr><tr><td>This is a difficult book to review.  It was so well written.  One cannot deny that Jonathan Franzen can construct a sentence, and can tell a story.  But if someone asks if it was 'good'. . . how does one choose 'good'? It was not pleasant.  That, I can say clearly.  It was, at times, so difficult to read.  But it was real.  The characters were people I know, people I'm related to, and sometimes, they were myself.  But often, it was the blue side of them, the dark side, the hidden side.  The side we don't want to acknowledge or have shown the light of day.  Even in the bleak persepctive, I found this book fascinating and somewhat compelling.  Yes, I would say it was 'good'; I would even say it was great.  I give it four stars rather than five because at times it was just a little preachy, but I still loved it. Several people have said it is not as good as Franzen's earlier book, The Corrections, and I can't comment on that--I haven't read it.  But I will say, that's not a completely fair thing to do to an author.  Each book should stand on its own, shouldn't it?  I understand The Corrections has more humor, and Freedom is not burdened with humor, but perhaps each reflects a different time in the writer's life, or is asking us to hearken to different tunes in our selves. . .?  I'm not sure.  I like humor as well as the next reader, but I don't think it belonged in this book.  This book was not meant to be cute or fun--it was meant to be honest. It's an honest portrayal of lifelong relationships, how they change, how those in them change.  It exposes hidden agendas, hidden dreams, how a decision at one point in a life can have ramifications in another.  The book was truly about freedom, and in at least a dozen instances freedom is discussed in vastly different ways.  But I think more than all the blatant freedoms discussed, the book is about the freedom to forgive ourselves who we were, and the decisions we made in a time before, and the freedom to become who we are, and forgive the mistakes we're sure to make in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>I love Hillerman and all of his characters and landscapes.  This was an enjoyable read for those reasons.  I am dissapointed by how many times Hillerman mentions Dodge Ram trucks in this novel.  It appears to me that he was paid a product placement fee to mention Dodge trucks throughout the book.  I counted seven instances of this and quite often, they were forced into the story.  I hope this was a coincidence, but it was too obvious to simply be that.  They interupted the flow of the story like a commercial in the middle of a chapter.</td></tr><tr><td>New York City is singular; it lends itself well to a book of this sort.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I found it quite frankly, fascinating, I got a real education on the city.  I am a Texan, but ive been to NYC, of course, and I love it, the city is so alive, it really is the greatest city on earth.  This book explores areas not often covered in books on the city, and all of the boroughs get attention, not just fabulous Manhattan.  You can tell the author has an affection for the city, it comes out in his writing, and that is appreciated.  If you have any interest in NYC or just enjoy books that come from a unique perspective, then I believe you will you will be pleased with this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Some of it was very disturbing, but I still wanted to know what was going to happen. I have to read the next book to see what happens to the children</td></tr><tr><td>Didn't like it as much as the Hunger Games series but a strong, likeable female lead and strong support characters.</td></tr><tr><td>The book was great! I am not going to discuss it but to say its great. No spoliers!! Love Love Love the whole series!!</td></tr><tr><td>When Bernard Cornwell wrote Sharpe's Rifles almost two decades ago, it is obvious he did not intend to add novels before the peninsular campaign. Now there are four, with the most recent being Sharp's Prey, a story of the British 1807 bombardment of Copenhagen with Richard Sharp serving as a spy. The story starts off slowly, with an explanation of Sharpe's experiences between Sharpe's Trafalgar and the current novel: his financial difficulties, the horror of London in 1807, and the introduction of the prey. It is not until we get half way into the book that the traditional Sharp appears, the battleground Sharp, although for the most part he is the spy Sharp. There is even a love interest. Some of the supporting cast comes from Sharpe's Trafalgar, but most are unique to this effort-and they are well drawn and interesting. Unfortunately, they must disappear, as the remaining history between Sharp's Prey and Sharpe's Rifles is Wellington in Portugal, most likely Cornwell's next Sharpe story. As always, Cornwell is a superb wordsmith. His descriptions of Copenhagen are real, and, from time to time, there are sentences that summarize a character-that say it all in shorthand. My only complaint is Sharpe's nemesis is not as evil as others in the series-I can almost like and understand this one.</td></tr><tr><td>Compelling , facinating, and frightening.  Very thought provoking.  Very well worth reading!</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for a student who wants to study international affairs and is planning to travel abroad to study.  I think I will buy one for myself because my knowledge of geography is lacking.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked this sequel and it definitely left me wanting more. I enjoy the simplicity of the authors work. It is easy and fun to read, but still describes the story well. I enjoyed the book and am excited for the next one!</td></tr><tr><td>Paul Sammon's Herculean effort predates by a decade what was effectively the 25th Anniversary release of Blade Runner, 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Final-Cut/dp/B0012PDVQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Final Cut</a>. Sammon's knowledge has never been in question; he is interviewed on the stellar three-and-a-half-hour documentary, Dangerous Days, available on two-, four-, and five-disc collections of that film. Cheesily, the publisher has pasted a \"25th Anniversary of Blade Runner\" pseudo-sticker on the front of this book, implying it reflects that most recent film release when it does not. Furthermore, and in extreme contrast to Ridley Scott, this paperback from It Books (a HarperCollins imprint) leaves much to be desired in terms of production. The text is too faint to be read easily in anything but optimal light, and the photo reproductions are embarrassingly poor. There's also typographic reproduction errors throughout, for example, the dates on page 10 and the unnecessary italics on pages 206 and 208. None of this is Sammon's fault. One could, however, take issue with the fanboy approach prevalent throughout the book. His apologist mantra is in evidence when he attempts to reconcile the small number of positive period reviews against the wall of sound that was critical press in 1982. A smaller issue, but one that smacks of laziness nonetheless: the author's inability to interview certain members of the cast. He first states that Morgan Paull (Holden) was sailing around the world; Future Noir took nearly three years to complete and surely a phone interview could have been scheduled at some point? Sammon later states that Joe Turkel (Tyrell) died and was therefore unavailable for interview; in fact, that actor is still alive even today. On the very much larger plus side, Future Noir is filled with production and script details that any Blade Runner savant-in-training will want to know. Again, however, the book's 1996 publication precludes the opportunity to tie up various loose ends, particularly the multiple versions of the film, e.g., International Cut, Workprint. As well, there are numerous points virtually screaming for updates. When screenwriter Hampton Fancher comments that he and co-screenwriter (and his replacement) David Peoples \"never did really collaborate on Blade Runner,\" one feels compelled to point out that one of the commentaries on the Final Cut DVD is an informative (and hugely entertaining) track from the Fancher-Peoples duo. There's so much material here (400+ pages) that it often gets repeated. Even the interview with Ridley Scott (Appendix A) is a composite of seven interviews over fifteen years! The lack of an Index doesn't help. The result is a sometimes rambling, incessantly glowing tribute to a film that will always be polarizing even if it is always remembered. Sammon needs to update his book and tell HarperCollins not to cheap out on the printing next time.</td></tr><tr><td>Great</td></tr><tr><td>Early Tolkien. I am SOOO happy!</td></tr><tr><td>This is classic American Jazz but has nothing to do with music or the culture.  Amazing writing.</td></tr><tr><td>A Good read and it kept my attention. It moves smoothly and keeps you guessing. I never would have guessed the ending.</td></tr><tr><td>Okay, if you demand a book listing a thousand ways to cook potatoes, this book is not for you. However, if you're throwing a dinner party and you've never cooked a roast before, this book will get you through it with an ease you never thought possible. My one disappointment is that there aren't a lot of \"serve with this\" suggestions; on the other hand, a quick flip through the section detailing the things I might serve with my roast (say, potatoes) will allow me to come up with a number of accompaniments I might not have thought of otherwise. I have the 1975 edition also. With all the slaps at the new edition, I have to say that a lot of the biases in the 1975 book are gone in the new one; e.g., the new one recognizes microwaves as a fact (necessity?) of life, where the earlier version deemed microwaves as unworthy of the authors. Every so often you've got to update, and as updates go, this is a very good one.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent.  But i don't think I could bear to see the movie. Marisa Samuels</td></tr><tr><td>Robin Hobb is one of those authors whose books will never leave my shelves. Books are my passion as I love to read. There are those I loan out, those I give away and those that will never leave my possession. This is one of those books. Assassin's Apprentice isn't as complicated as say the Liveship Trilogy, but I'm OK with that. Sometimes, it's fun to read a simpler tale told by one character's point-of-view. If it's done well, you never feel like you need to know more. When I say Robin's story was simple, it's only simple from point-of-view, not storyline. Robin has a way of weaving things together. At times, you may feel like it's slow going and wonder \"what does this scene matter?\" But with Robin, they all matter. She pulls things together and unfolds them bit by bit until you near the end and can't put it down. There's no wasted words with her, only delicately chosen words which paint a stunning picture. As a writer trying to break through the glass ceiling, I respect and admire her. She is one of the most gifted authors I've ever read. I will continue to read her work and sing her praises for she has not disappointed me, yet. Well done, Robin!</td></tr><tr><td>The book was in great shape and was an excellent read!  It was for a lit class and did the job wonderfully</td></tr><tr><td>I have a continued interest in this era. The book kept me interested from cover to cover.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved the \"Divergent\" series.  Fast paced and definitely different than anything I have read before!  I loved the pace and the fact that it was different in that ...I couldn't always predict what was going to happen like I do with other series.</td></tr><tr><td>If you can suffer through the somewhat lengthy and 'not so exciting' beginning of the book, the latter part makes it worth while.  The story of the shawl is much more interesting than the people that are trying to unravel it's history in modern times.  The characters are well formed and the setting well researched.</td></tr><tr><td>The pace of the book keeps up with the pace of the occupation of France; action, reaction not quite as expected; an easy way out not taken, more talents than realized not sold; cold, lack of money, lack of luck, not so much gained by what is done but by not cooperating allows misadventure and a more difficult way forward for the occupation.</td></tr><tr><td>I really enjoyed this book. I had stopped reading the Bastion Club, then went back and read them over. I loved the main characters and was pleased to see her trademark strong heroines.</td></tr><tr><td>Biblical significense, with amazing insight to the Israeli historical first Temple, good intrigue concerning artifacts and their trafficking throughout the black market and political spinoff with Hezbollah and Israelis. Gives the reader lots of historical understanding concerning the ongoing battles between ancient cultures.</td></tr><tr><td>3.5 stars This is a stand alone by the author. Detective Constable Callum MacGregor of the Scotland Police is a character that reminds me of Job in the bible. Every bad thing that you can imagine happens to him. He is assigned to a \"misfit squad\" because management believes that he took a bribe by ruining crime evidence and causing a major criminal to go free. In fact, it was his pregnant girlfriend, who is a crime scene technician. His squad is assigned what looks like a joke-- investigating a mummy found in a garbage dump. This is a very long book, 604p. It held my interest with some false leads, as the team gradually realize that they are dealing with a serial killer. There is a humorous side to the book as some weird dietary habits are mentioned--raspberry jam on anchovy pizza?! I think the book was a little too long. The characters were believable and plot led up to a satisfactory ending. Another character that I liked was Rosalind Franklin, an attractive black woman, sent to the misfit squad after she punched a Superintendent who grabbed her bottom. Some quotes by Callum: \"Why did no one ever come back when they were told to? Anyone would think that people didn't want to get arrested.\" \"Poor sod. Living with Franklin must be like trying to cross a minefield on a pogo stick every day. Blindfold. While sadists threw burning squirrels at you.\" Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher, HarperCollins for sending me this book.</td></tr><tr><td>This is my favorite book. I needed a copy to make a decoupage table top.  Other than that, which worked fine, the service was good and it arrived in as described condition.</td></tr><tr><td>If you haven't read Dean Koontz he is my favorite author of science fiction/horror.  Odd Thomas the main character tends to bring humor and a slower pace to Koontz's intense thrillers and I will continue to read any book featuring Odd.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was amazing I finished it within 24hour period.  The first I've ever read of Lisa Kleypas' work.  I would compare her writings to Julia Quinn's masterpieces.  She has written a brilliant love story about overcoming social standards and how love conquers all.  I can't convey how much I love this story of Simon & Annabelle.  Kleypas created a great segue into her next book in the Wallflowers series.  There's an emotional attachment to all the characters in this book.  I liked this book so much that I also bought the E-Book for my iPhone.  :)</td></tr><tr><td>The horrible review is definitely NOT for Laura Ingalls Wilder. She is one of my all time favorite authors and anyone who has read this far into her series doesnt need a review to know that. The reason for the lack of stars is the pages of the book. They were done on some sort of slippery BRIGHT white paper... almost like they were plastic or somthing. This made the illustrations beautiful but made it almost impossible to read. Between the mirror like glare and the blinding white I could barely read the wonderful story!!!</td></tr><tr><td>well written</td></tr><tr><td>Super action ,very fast paced towards the end. A VERY good read,want more by this author. Can't go wrong by him.</td></tr><tr><td>You'll enjoy this book. I enjoyed it and found it an easy read. Certainly not a literary masterpiece, but I learned a lot about her and her most endearing quality--her love for Ani Difranco!</td></tr><tr><td>One of the things that have always bothered me about the old cinderella stories it's that the character have no depth whatsoever. The prince barely has a line! That's why I was so happy when I found this book, I love fairy tales and this book it's one of the best I've read. Ella has a personality on her own, so does Char, the prince. The obstacules they face are believable - yeah, in the middle of a fairy tale you find yourself believing even when you're sorrounded by ogres and fairies and centaurs - Ella has never have a voice on herself. As a baby, a fairy by the name of Lucinda gave her a \"Gift\": Obedience. Order Ella to do something and she will do it, no matter what. It's a secret her mother, Mandy - cook and fairy good mother extraordinaire! - and Ella herself work hard to keep. Then Ella faces the loss of her mother and things start to go not so well. But she does meet Prince Char, who it's fond of her. And well, you know the story. Though in this retealing you will find more than one surprise. And the Ending leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Go with Ella as she try to find her own voice and the power to make her own choices.</td></tr><tr><td>When I first read Wolf Hall, I thought a lot of the action was misdirected to the sidelines and rehashed in conversations (though clever) because Hilary Mantel writes from Cromwell's perspective.  Before reading this book, I re-read it and see I kind of missed the point.  Cromwell's perspective shows us that even the mighty King Henry the VIII was forced to use Cromwell to accomplish his goals.  Mantel also has a real gift for enlivening the characters.  This is a main point of both books because let's face it--there are no major plot twists.  Mantel employs this gift even more in Bringing up the Bodies.  After Henry with Cromwell's help was able to set aside his anointed Queen Katherine, he is once again frustrated with his Queen.  The marriage has yielded nothing but a girl, and after Anne miscarries, Henry is ready to walk away.  Can Thomas Cromwell secure him a way out? We know that of course he can. The genius of this series is the characterization of Cromwell.  Mantel gives him a lot of sympathetic strokes:  a rough child hood, grief over his mentor the late Cardinal, his dead wife and daughters.  But Mantel also presents a ruthless Cromwell with a score to settle.  An ambitious and brilliant man who could build a few whispers and confidences into a case that would change court and country.  He's no longer apologizing for who he is but instead replying to prostrations of innocence with lines like, \"Life pays you out, Norris.  Don't you find?  And...It is not all about the cardinal, either.  I would not want you to think I am without motives of my own.\" Mantel is more focused as well telling the story of a few months' time -- the events leading up to Anne's trial. Bringing up the Bodies is the most legal account of Anne's fall that I've ever read comparable even to the non-fiction on the subject.  Cromwell's artful case construction is fascinating.  Those who know the key \"players\" and the historical record leading up to the story will have an easier time.  The majority of backstory is limited to a genealogical chart.  Mantel also clearly favors Cromwell, who as he is taking down men and women innocent of one crime but \"guilty of something\", the Boleyn's still come across as the threatening force.  One of the most fascinating things about this drama is that no one escapes, so I am eagerly awaiting book 3 and hoping it offers a take on Cromwell's own demise.</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoy reading about children's cases, and this author focuses her research on the accounts of children. This is a very good read on this topic.</td></tr><tr><td>If this were a fictional story, you would think it was far-fetched. I saw the film first, which I can now say is very true to the book. I found the film painful to watch, as I could not help empathizing with Joe. I feared the book would be worse, since I would be inside his head, but somehow it was not. He does describe all of the hardships, especially the emotional hardships, but in a matter of fact way that somehow was not painful for me.</td></tr><tr><td>Great buy!!</td></tr><tr><td>Okay, so not the ABSOLUTE best, but by golly definitely one of them.  At first, you think, \"Oh, no, I'm going to hate this Amory Blaine, I really am.\"  But then he grows on you somehow, because you can say to at least one of the situations he gets in--usually the abortive romantic ones--that you've been there, too.  Especially good for young men (although by no means just them) and aspiring writers of whatever gender.  I liked the way Fitzgerald experiments a bit (the one scene done in the form of a play) and how he ends the book with a phrase that many of us can say, at the end of our journeys--- \"`I know myself,` he cried, `but that is all.`\"</td></tr><tr><td>This novel is about the love stories of sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. The story starts off quite slow, and Austen does not use as much dialogue as I would prefer. But still the whole time reading, I was anxious to know the ending. The LAST TWO chapters hurriedly summarizes the girls' happy endings. It's as if Austen suddenly ran out of time and had to finish quickly. While it's a good enough ending (I have mixed feelings on Marianne's part), I would have appreciated more detail, dialogue, and perspective of the men in the novel, instead of it having such a rushed ending. I have not seen the movie, but I would guess it to be far more satisfying than the book.</td></tr><tr><td>I've been putting off reading this book for almost a year. Now I wish I read it sooner. I loved it! Once I started, I was hooked and could not put it down. Granted this book is not for everyone. The slang could be off-putting but it worked perfectly for this book. The story is narrated by an uneducated, feral girl named Elka. She was just seven years old, wandering lost and hungry in the wilderness, when a solitary hunter took her in. Never knowing his name, she called him Trapper. For ten years he taught her how to hunt, shoot, set snares and start fires, everything she needed to survive. Everything changes when she goes to town and sees a Wanted Poster with his picture. She decides to escape his clutches and sets out on a long journey in the hope of finding her long-lost parents. But as the trail of blood and bodies grows in her path, Elka realizes that daddy won't be letting his little girl go without a fight. This book can be dark and I highly recommend it if you like a post-apocalyptic suspense story. I would like to thank NetGalley and Crown Publishing for supplying a copy of Beth Lewis's \"The Wolf Road\" in exchange for an honest review.</td></tr><tr><td>Great buy seller has much integrity!</td></tr><tr><td>Everybody should read Hamlet. It is brilliant.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was written in a truly unique style, with the author often revealing what happens in the future first, and then going on to explain the plot and events that happen up until the revealed moment. The story is about a South American town called Macondo and the family that founded it. The book has a very mystical feel and is constantly entertaining. Would highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>The parables and allegories of cs lewis are so illustrative and convincing. Again, here they do not fail to teach principles of heaven and hell, and how we humans may attain our highest potential in this life and the next.</td></tr><tr><td>Sure it will be great when I have time to read</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Straub's \"Shadowland\" is a coming of age story with fantastical events, horrific twists and classic tragic plot turns.  All these elements beg the reader to want to love this novel, but in the end the story comes across empty somehow (even if the last 150 pages is a terrifically executed wild ride). As adolescents at a boarding school Del Nightingale and Tom Flanagan form a bond through a mutual love of magic.  The boys, who spend a summer at Shadowland with Del's uncle ( a grand wizard of magic), soon realize that their bond was no accident and all the events leading-up to their final summer together were not just random series of events.  Shadowland tests their skills, morality and friendship in ways they never expected. Peter Straub's introduction explains that much of \"Shadowland\" was conceived as a tribute of sorts to fairy tales.  That influence is felt through out the book in its style and stories within the action (King of Cats, mermaids, The Brothers Grimm, The Goose Girl, evil sorcerers...).  It is fun to try and catch all the references, although I must admit I am sure I missed 95% of them.  Unfortunately, it is the need to present \"Shadowland\" as a fairy tale that really pulled the book down for me.  Fairy tales are stories told by a third party who is telling a tale passed on to them, and \"Shadowland\" is no different.  The story is told to us by a narrator who is communicating what he was told by our hero Tom Flanagan.  Because we are not getting the information first hand (although the action is written as if the reader is present at the time it happened), there is a detachment to the horror and the reader questions if what is happening is real.  Because the novel's plot is based on magic, there are illusions and hallucinations to further confuse the reader as to what is happening.  It is this confusion and lack of identity with the characters and events that made an intriguing plot somewhat dull and uninspiring. Although it contains terrific writing, \"Shadowland\" falters due to the authors sweeping attempt to do too much which gets in the way of presenting an effective story.  I wanted to like the story but it never lived up to expectations.</td></tr><tr><td>There's no way you can read this with long breaks, you have to keep reading it. There's a lot going on in the story and little mental notes to take in while you read, it's not hard to do but if don't I'm certain any reader would be a bit lost. The story starts off a bit choppy, several events happening and cutting into each other until the end where you're sent flying off a motorized scooter. The ending was reallyyyy... well just read it. I'd go into more detail but any detail is spoilers.</td></tr><tr><td>The book is booring, and repetive</td></tr><tr><td>Enthralling from start to finish. I wish it had been longer. I wish the main characters story went on and had a better wrap up on the mountain.</td></tr><tr><td>I greatly enjoyed the plot development of this story. Yes, there are few surprises, but well-fleshed out secondary characters are one of them and always welcome.</td></tr><tr><td>Really interesting.</td></tr><tr><td>I should have listened to my friends who told me this book was incredibly weird and disturbing. They were right! I'm probably going to have nightmares! But I'm still glad I read it, because it's got a unique, clear voice and has some really important things to say. And also, if you're less delicate than I am and you like tense, suspenseful horror, you'll love this book.</td></tr><tr><td>This is just a great story and the perfect prequel for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It's a classic!</td></tr><tr><td>As in her other books, special ed teacher Torey Hayden charts a year in the life of her students...this time focusing upon Jadie Ekdahl, an electively mute little girl. Being warned about all the past teachers who have tried to get Jadie to speak but failed, Hayden is surprised when she succeeds in getting the child to answer her questions within hours of her arrival. Once Jadie does begin to speak, she hints of horrible abuse she and her younger sisters have suffered, abuse which is either pornographic or Satanic in nature. Although Hayden does help Jadie significantly, she never does learn the full story behind the abuse, as the child cannot understand everything she's been through, her parents vehemently deny it...and the community as a whole refuses to believe anything at all's happened. It's a bit of a letdown for readers, getting into the details of an abused child's life, yet never learning what really happened in the end. Although this book -- like all of Hayden's others -- crosses into the realm of potential sap, preachiness or self-admiration, it never goes there. While Heyden's quest to help the children -- and resulting success with them -- puts her well ahead of other educators, she never takes on the air of patting herself on the back for it. Rather, she is a mere human; one who often becomes frustrated, as anyone else might be; and far from perfect. Often, as she becomes fixated on the children, Heyden forgets to balance the other areas of her life, which become problematic as a result. This is a fascinating look at the life of a child suffering incredibly bizarre abuse, and how one caring individual tried to help.</td></tr><tr><td>In 1838 James and Sadie Goodenough head west, leaving their Connecticut family apple orchards in the hopes of starting their own farm. As their wagon gets stuck in the ubiquitous mud of Ohio's Black Swamp, the family also becomes stuck upon that land. James begins to grow his beloved apples in a land inhospitable to orchards, while Sadie begins to lose her spirit as swamp fever takes five of her ten children. The uneasiness within the Goodenough household mounts until tragedy occurs. The story moves between Sadie's and James' POV in 1838, then youngest son Robert's POV as he travels the West working various outdoor jobs. It's clear he's seeking something, though he doesn't seem to understand just what. Each year, Robert sends a letter home to his siblings - a letter that is never answered. Each year, Robert moves on. Chevalier masterfully spins a blend of complex fictitious characters with some real historical figures such as John Chapman (\"Johnny Appleseed\") sprinkled within, creating an intense story readers will not forget.</td></tr><tr><td>My granddaughter loves this book!</td></tr><tr><td>Jim Collins analyzes several companies that have gone from being mediocre to excellent. He finds that they have been able to create a set of characteristics, including the following, which enabled them to go from good to great. Level 5 Leadership - Level 5 Leaders are driven, humble, modest and more concerned about the prosperity of the company than their individual success. They resolve to do whatever it takes to make the company great, no matter how hard the decisions are. First Who ANd Then What - Using a bus analogy, Collins claims that great companies first get great people on the bus, then decide where to drive it. According to Collins, the right people are your most important asset. The Hedgehog Concept - Good-to-Great companies do what they can do best (not what they want to do best), what they are deeply passionate about, and they focus on what drives their economic engine. A Culture of Discipline - Discipline means that there is little or no need for hierarchy, bureaucracy, or excessive control. Confront the Brutal Facts - These companies believe that they will prevail in the end, but also have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of their current situation. Good Technology - Technology can help accelerate moving from good to great but is not the cause of it. Overall, an excellent book that helps you see what you are doing right or wrong in your organization.</td></tr><tr><td>If you've already seen the Gilmore Girls TV show, then you'll like this book! It has a lot of the dialogue from the show. It covers episodes: -The Pilot -The Lorelais' First day at Chilton -Kiss and Tell -Rory's Dance -Forgiveness and Stuff If you haven't seen the TV show, you should read this book, (or the whole Gilmore Girls book series!) and then watch the show. I think it would be very interesting to see all the charactors after reading the book(s).</td></tr><tr><td>Mandela's family had served as advisors to tribal kings for generations, and this way of life was shattered.  His personal freedom and rights were curtailed and he saw it happening to all his people.  He and many others led protests that led to long imprisonments and disruption of their personal lives.  Somehow he keeps his personal dignity,continues to study even though he is already an educated lawyer, and communicates his ideas even thought he is imprisoned. He begins to think more and more of the big picture of all the people of Africa and not just of his people and this belief and motivation eventually frees South Africa.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is going to be a challenge for how many books I have to read for my classes, but I am interested in reading it! Thank you very much for being a great seller!</td></tr><tr><td>I have an earlier edition and am stunned that this book remains in print. I really can't put my finger on why, but it is among the most disappointing text books that I have attempted to use. For me, it made learning too painful. I urge you to try before you buy. Borrow one and see for yourself. If my professor assigned this text I would drop the class, but then this isn't my first rodeo.</td></tr><tr><td>The dictionary is helpful for the most part. Sometimes I found it hard to manipulate looking for an obtuse clue! Most of the time though when I was stuck on a clue the word I needed was right there!</td></tr><tr><td>This is the Classic it was made to be by history. It is the story of conflict, greed, war crimes, torture embedded in the Euro-American DNA. It could well be India, Africa or the Middle East in illustrating the capacity for cruelty and the conspiracy between the Cross and the Crown to demonize humans as a pre-condition to Genocide/race colonization and Exceptionalism based on Divine and Human tenets of racial superiority. In his detailed documentations of \"wars\" which were actually massacres, Dee Brown overlooks a simple moral observation that has saturated books on Native Americans: that white men simply had no business here!  All the history that sadly ensued begs that simple moral verity. A must read book that should be supplemented by any of Vine Deloria's works on how the \"assimilate or exterminate\" imperialism and crimes against humanity endure today in each of our Republic's fifty states. Vine Deloria: God is Red; Custer Died for You Sins; We Talk, You Listen.</td></tr><tr><td>An accurate rendition.  Very interesting.</td></tr><tr><td>I initially picked this book up for two reasons--I liked Alexie's novel, Indian Killer, and more importantly because I live in Spokane, WA and have traveled extensively through the Reservations and towns that are described in the stories. The descriptions and the characters are very realistic, the names and places are not very fictionalized, and it makes me feel right at home. Fortunately for those readers not privleged to live in the Inland Northwest, the stories also teach a lot about Indian culture, the modern Native American and their heritage. It is a disturbing picture at times with too much alcaholism, violence, and racism, but underneath it all there is a great deal of love which makes the stories comforting and redeeming. Alexie has a lyrical voice, and when combined with his authenticsity, beautiful, rich stories are produced. Aside from those academic traits, he is also very funny, honest, and affectionate throughout, and those qualities are what I will remember about this book far more than the descriptions of familiar hotels on Third Avenue and the basketball games played between Springdale and Wellpinit. It is a great, quick read, and a wonderful way to pass an afternoon.</td></tr><tr><td>Any and everything i have read by this author has been wonderful.  This book is appropriate for anyone, and is a fast read.  Discworld and Terry Pratchett rock.</td></tr><tr><td>Emily, Spencer, Aria and Hanna have been reunited after years of broken friendship when their secrets and lies are on the brink of being exposed. Who is A, and what secrets will they uncover next? Flawless is a great read with loads of suspense and it will definitely keep you guessing.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was nothing like I imagined and I loved it. It was such a different way of writing then what I am used to. I love how the story is written through a series of letters, emails, and instant messaging. It was a roller coaster of emotions from laughing to being completely furious and wanting to stop reading. It really shows how life can get in the way of your plans, however, if it's meant to be it will work out.</td></tr><tr><td>Why I read It I like early Guns & Roses, Slash is arguably one of the best in the world at what he does, and I found him interesting on his turn as celebrity mentor on American Idol. What I Thought About It First of all this book is very honest. Very honest about being in a rock band, the personality struggles between the various members, and what it is like being a junkie. You feel some sympathy for him, but he takes responsibility for a lot of the problems in his life. If you ever want to be a rock star you need to read this first; hopefully you can avoid a lot of problems in your career. The biggest and best message of the book for me was what it takes to be great, in this case the guitar. Slash was a major BMX'er in his youth until he got a guitar as a teenager. From that day forward he just gave up riding. I think it speaks to the power of finding our true love in life. Once you have it you never waste anymore time on distractions. I am not sure if that sort of dedication is required to be great, but it surely cannot hurt. His first guitar was a cheap acoustic with only one string, but that didn't stop him from practicing for hours. He would play the notes up and down the one string until he could get the rest. I also like how he learns that you cannot really be great guitar player by copying someone else's style. It is okay to learn from other's, but you have to be yourself. Very Bruce Lee like. Ultimately he learned that he had to give up trying to read sheet music for other people's songs and just keep trying things out as he learned songs by ear. After many hours of practicing he would eventually figure it out, but in the process he learned a lot about how the notes and tempo work together. So we have dedication (without distraction), tons of practice (you should love practicing), no excuses about why you can't (as they say in ultramarathoning RFD, relentless forward motion no matter what), and be true to yourself (innovate not imitate). The second message for me was the effects of drugs and how they can control you and ultimately destroy you and those in your life.</td></tr><tr><td>We love all the critter books! Great for kids that might be afraid of storms and scary noises.</td></tr><tr><td>I used to read books like this when I was young and had more time, and I loved the stories.  I have found that as an adult, wow, people used a LOT of words to say something simple back then. The story is the classic tale that I have long loved, but reading it is a bit tedious.</td></tr><tr><td>A really good read. The usual action that I have come to expect from the author. High tech reading fun at it's best</td></tr><tr><td>I love Sue Monk Kidd's writings and this book was no exception. She touches my heart as always.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very good general biography of Malcolm X.  It is very concise and easy to read.</td></tr><tr><td>The characters were interesting and believable.  I especially liked the dynamic between the women.  It also had an interesting, engaging plot.  Just edgy enough.</td></tr><tr><td>This story carried me far from how we grew up in America to a very primitive life in an African village. I got a real sense of  the language and the customs along with the mental strengths and weaknesses of growing and living in a primitive social group. The story flows well and I found it quite compelling.</td></tr><tr><td>Science fiction and fantasy author Adele Harris leaves Boise to go home to Cedar Creek, Texas to help her pregnant older sister Sherrilyn who is in the hospital while her husband William moved in with his college age assistant Stormy. Adele is caring for her thirteen years old niece Kendra. She thinks of Zach Zemaitis who broke her heart fourteen years ago. A former professional football player and U of Texas legend, the widower Zach is trying to raise his ten year old daughter in Tiffany in his late wifes hometown. This forces him to pretend he cared about Devon who was a malicious person and the cause of his break up with his beloved Adele. Zach is stunned to see Adele, who he never stopped loving, but knows she will never forgive him for the big hurt. Meanwhile in the afterlife Devon Hamilton-Zemaitis must pay for her bad karma on earth as dying by crashing into a garbage truck is fitting but not enough her job is to bring Adele and Zach together, the way it should have been. This is a whimsical second chance at love romance in which the paranormal is kept to a minimal, but brings karma and humor to the mix. Readers will relish Zachs efforts to regain what he lost years ago while Adele wants to avoid him like the plague. Devon brings humor to the mix starting with her former late schoolteacher lecturing her, a trip to Wal-Mart and the need for her as pompous mother to back off from interfering in her mission. Rachel Gibson provides a warm Texas contemporary with a conniving matchmaker from beyond.</td></tr><tr><td>Mere Novels C.S. Lewis has been praised for his intellectual books and articulation of his beliefs about Christianity. Indeed, Lewis is very intellectual and this is evident by his ideas and expression of them. On top of being a very intellectual man, he also wrote his book in a different time era so the language has a different sound; this caused me to concentrate harder. But, a book that makes you concentrate is a book well written. If you can get past the overall impressive articulation then you will see that he is dealing with hard and complex ideas, yet, is able to put them in easier terms for the average reader. I think this a great and use full skill and I look up to that.   Like the title suggests, the book deals with mere Christianity. In simpler terms, the basics of Christianity. In fact, in the first section of the book he uses science and the science of psychology to prove the existence of God and the need of one. Then he progresses into the meaning of Christianity. His humility is admirable in the way that he shows that he may be wrong and also by saying that there are other Christian viewpoints on a subject, (proverbs 22:4). I very much thought his arguments and evidence were clear, but I would have liked to have seen more scripture. Even though I can tell as a person who has read the Bible that he is using the Bible to support Christian claims. I would have liked it if he specifically pointed them out. In places where he said this is supported in the Bible maybe then he could name the references so as not to confuse the reader as to whether he thinks God said that or if actually came from God. I understand though that he is merely outlining what Christian belief is at its core and that this may not always be completely based on the Bible. He also was not afraid to address the hard truths about God. An example of a hard truth is that there is only one way to heaven. Many people reject Christianity for this reason alone. Lewis says that good deeds alone cannot get you into heaven only the belief that Christ came to earth in the flesh to forgive us of our sins. The book was very straightforward and did not leave a lot of room for misinterpretation.   This book should probably be read by a young believer. This is perfect for a young believer as it outlines what a Christian believes and how one should act. [To have Faith in Christ] means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you. (C.S. Lewis. Mere Christianity.)  Furthermore, after reading a book that tells the basic principles and actions of a Christian, the reader would be able to discern if he would want to continue in his faith. Another person for whom the book would be good would be a person looking for a reason why they believe what they believe. In other words, an apologist.  Mere Christianity does an excellent job explaining the whys in detail. Some people find it easier to simply hand the book off to their unbelieving friend. Although I find that this would work with Mere Christianity I personally would discuss this book with your friend as a great learning experience- experience that would allow you to see through the eyes of a non-believer.   Altogether I truly enjoyed this book. As a young adult I cannot express how helpful I found this book. Psalm 119:43 says  Never take the word of truth from my mouth, for I have put hope in your laws. God has placed trust in mere humans and I believe that Gods trust in Lewis helped him to speak the truth. I liked how Lewis spoke about the science of God, morality, faith, and pride. These I thought to be the most pleasurable to read because they were new ideas to me and they had a lot of truth to them as well. I think that whomever reads this book will not walk away without some new helpful idea or way of expression towards an old idea. He recycles ideas and makes them original.  Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.(C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity.)  Lewiss book may have some dry parts but overall it is an amazing and insightful book.. I would recommend this book to any who are willing to read it.   Enemy-occupied territory---that is what this world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us to take part in a great campaign of sabotage.   -C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>The Sherlock Holmes Adventures have always been a favorite of mine and so when I found a friend who had never read them, I couldn't wait to introduce them to her.  She informs me that she loves them as much as I do and that it is a very nicely bound volume.  I asked her how she would rate the volume and the writing and she gave each 5 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>The best of Furst's first 5 books in the series initiated with \"Night Soldiers\".  Furst has a talent for drawing true-to-life characters in extraordinary circumstances, and Alexander de Milja, Polish intelligence officer, is one of his best and most personable creations.  De Milja works tirelessly for the Polish government in exile, from Paris to Flanders to the wild east where the Poles, Ukraines, and Russians conspire against each other while battling the German occupiers.  While I loved both \"Night Soldiers\" and \"Dark Star\" for their action, atmosphere, and characterizations, \"The Polish Officer\" comes together in a more satisfying way, and feels more \"complete\".</td></tr><tr><td>A must read for followers of the Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings. A history of the world before them.</td></tr><tr><td>A fun read!  She is a very good writer with great characters and a good story.  Had a hard time putting the book down and didn't want it to end either.</td></tr><tr><td>The best!</td></tr><tr><td>A very real retelling of stories that have happened over the last 60-70 years.  A detailed history of the Hell's Angels told by the man that started it all.  Sonny does not hold anything back and every detail in every story is recounted as if it is happening right then.  I read it over the course of about a week and enjoyed it very much.</td></tr><tr><td>Set in the crucible of the Catholic church crisis, in a fictional suburb of Boston, \"Faith\" offers us a different voice, one not often heard when discussing the subject.  LIving in Boston as I did during the seemingly endless revelations of betrayal, I heard many viewpoints - those of victims, lawyers for victims, lawyers for the Church, church spokespeople, priests' sermons on Sundays, and the so-called \"listening sessions\" held in every parish during the upheaval that still affects the credibility of Catholic leaders today.  Jennifer Haigh brings us another viewpoint, that of an accused priest's sister.  The book weaves through a Catholic family's history of secrets, unshakable faith, and questioned faith.  Love between sister and brother, brother and brother, mother and son, fathers and sons get tangled in the vines of Haigh's narrative. She develops and reveals characters that are strong or weak, silent or outspoken, angry or supportive-- all in all a typical Catholic family.  In the middle is Art, the center of attention.  Priest, man, brother, friend.  But perpetrator?  We don't know until the suspense brings us to the brink, to the end.  Themes of denial, love, infidelity, celibacy, sacrifice, fear and ignorance take the reader on this journey of Sheila, Art's sister, and loyal defender.  But even she has her moments of doubt.  The irony of just who discovers whether Art is guilty of the crime he is accused of gives us the answer, and ultimately forces the reader to question their own beliefs. I highly recommend this book for anyone who would like another take on the betrayal so many of us felt, and continue to feel.</td></tr><tr><td>Perfect as always Thank you</td></tr><tr><td>I've been enjoying this book for over ten years.  Highly recommended for the naturalist in your life, especially the young ones. The illustrations are spectacular.  The amphibian section is mindblowingly realistic and they are all works of art.  It's a great reference book and an interesting addition to your coffee table. The main animal phyla are covered: mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and fish. Subsequent orders are all found. I wish they'd make an encyclopedia that would cover lower forms--I bet that would be amazing!  This is a useful guide for any traveler encountering new beasties.</td></tr><tr><td>Philippa Gregory.... never a dull read. Highly recommend this book. I am not into telling you what the storyline or characters are about. The inside sleeve does that well enough. She is a very talented author and I have read many of her books. I recommend them all actually.</td></tr><tr><td>Second time through this book. Amazing detail on every page. Tolkien created a world so intricate and with so much texture that you could spend a year digging into just the tales in this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of hints but stays a mystery till the end and adds another surprise then!  Good book for a rainy reading day!</td></tr><tr><td>This has become my favorite novel.</td></tr><tr><td>I had to read this book for school.  It was okay. I probably wouldn't have chosen to read it on my own, but it was a fairly easy read.</td></tr><tr><td>A bizarre mixture of Blake, Whitman and Williams, Allen Ginsbergs poetry has at the same time lampooned as the scribings of a mentally unstable homosexual and praised as the musings of an American genius. Whatever the take, Ginsberg is certainly enagaging. Chronicling everything from his own psycholgical frailty to the evils of capitalism, the trials of Judaism to buddhist meditation, \"sprawling\" hardly begins to describe the breadth of Ginsbergs work. Indeed, he represents such a wide sphere of American consciousness and American society, that it is impossible not to be impressed by something in this volume that covers 33 years of his work. At the very least he is erratic. Most of the time, he's just down right crazy. And that's a big part of the charm.</td></tr><tr><td>I had a vague memory of having read this years ago as a teenager, but had no memory of what the story was about.  So recently I reread it and enjoyed it. Meg's father has been missing for over a year.  Meg, her brother Charles, and Calvin, a neighbor boy, go on an adventure to try and rescue Meg & Charles' father.  The are aided by three strange women who have magical powers and take them to several planets along the way.  Meg's father has been captured by a great evil.  The great evil then captures Charles.  Meg and Calvin are left alone, and then Meg is alone. It is a fun, entertaining story.  I read it all in one sitting.  If you like fantasy then give this story a try, you'll enjoy it.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good read. The book is based in the Pacific. Our adventure starts in Hawaii, a University  Prof. is turned down for tenure, though he has brilliant publications of the Pacific Ocean, it Navigation and trade routes. He list in an appendix a mystical island of the navigaotrs from legend. And writes it as if it is a fact. An island no one has ever seen. He and a mismatched group of people sail in search of this island. And when the find it...the novel really begins. I do not want to spoil anything...but the book is a very fast read.</td></tr><tr><td>While you think an archeologist or a religious historian should have written this book, it wasn't. Burleigh who is a reporter wrote it. And the book reads like a compilation of her notes. The author also seemed too be trying to write two different types of books at the same time. She would have done herself a favor by breaking out the two separate subjects, performed more research and written two. The books should have been broken into one on the theft and selling of minor antiquities in Israel and the Palestinian areas, which is a thriving business. The street vendors sell them, but you will not know if you are buying a genuine artifact, which is quite possible, or a replica that is almost prefect down to ever detail. And the second book, the reason most people I am sure will buy it, covers the three recently exposed forgeries of the James Ossuary, the Jehoash Tablet, and an ornamental pomegranate thought to come from that same temple. In each case, the forgery technique was the same. Legitimate but unimportant artifacts from the proper era had inscriptions added that made them historically significant and those inscriptions were then altered to look ancient. These subjects are covered in the last part of the book. If you are truly interested in the subject of these artifacts, this is not the book for you. But if you are a tourist or plan to be one, and think you will be able to buy an artifact as a souvenir you should read this book; for she has filled this book on tour of ancient artifacts and their black-market fraud. The book at first glance has a good layout and the title does tell you what is covered. Though I must admit I think she is honest in her writing for she lets us readers know what she has no background what so ever in religion.  Yet she has taken it upon her self to assume too understand the complex dynamics that make up a city rich in history, culture and turmoil as Jerusalem. She is woefully ignorant on the subject she is writing about and contradicts known proven findings archeology with generalized statements. Her writing leads me to the conclusion that she has decided that religion is basically superstition. And all that she is riding is based on the basic fundamental belief. Another reviewer stated very accurately what here on Amazon my exact feelings on this book; \"My initial annoyance and disappointment with \"Unholy Business\" was ultimately tempered when I realized that I was not reading a scholarly work on archaeology, history, linguistics or even criminal forensics, but a kind of breezy and highly personalized travelogue.\" It does not take long to reach this realization and it was a great disappointment to me. For this is a subject and area I am very interested in. I think the two quotes at the front of her book summarize her feelings on this subject. The first is that we as civilization, civilized people deceive those who are to be deceived in order to make a living. And the other is that there are two kinds of people, \"those who want to know and those who want to believe.\" One good thing, the book is a fast read.</td></tr><tr><td>Read this to my kids at bedtime, and they loved it.  And, even as children (though smart ones!) they saw the clear symbolism of Christ, His redemptive work, the sacrifice of the King, the wages of sin, etc.  The books-to-movies movement, and the strength of the science fiction market, and the fact that this is another classic masterpiece that Hollywood needs to gobble and digest into crap  - all mean that this work will be categorized (or attempted to be so) as just another piece of science fiction.  That would be a misappropriation.</td></tr><tr><td>The events leading to the Second World War are as fascinating as the events of the War itself, and infinitely more complex and consequential than any work of fiction.  Wouk (and his researchers) have provided us with a marvelous gift in this book, which presents a cleverly developed fictitious tale set among ALL of the major events and players of this real life drama. I am writing this review in March of 2008.  The US is experiencing multiple financial crises in the housing, credit, and energy markets.  We are at war with seemingly unobtainable goals.  We are witnessing a baffling and discouraging presidential contest.  Terrorism seems to rule nearly every aspect of our lives (and even so, we are one of the safest nations on Earth - in other words, it is much worse in other places . . . .).  All of that stated, March of 2008 looks like a cakewalk compared to nearly any place in the world in the late 1930's and early 1940's, when fascist (and socialist, and imperialist) politics, rapidly developing war technologies, the last vestiges of old world European colonialism, and the overwhelming power of racism (anti-Semitism, among others), combined to change the maps of nearly every major power and realign the world for the time not yet ended.  This masterful work of fiction sheds a fascinating light on the rise of this war, while also providing a great story. About the fiction of this work, Wouk invented an interesting family whose characters, all taken together, are present for active roles in just about every major event of the coming war.  As such, this is like a modern Shakespearian classic - we are treated to the very human actions and emotions of legends (good and bad) through the eyes of Pug Henry and his family.  What a hell of a book.  At some regrettable points, the book borders on sappy, and some (and I stress, only a few) scenes are just not believable (like Warren Henry being shot down over Pearl Harbor, and dropping in at his house to see the wife before snagging another plane and getting back in the fight).  These missteps are few and forgivable.  The characters are universally flawed, which is a refreshing departure from the typical pop fiction approach - sometimes I would find myself angry with some of these characters and their actions - what a great reaction to pull out of your reader! This is a recommended book for war and history buffs, but I think it can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates readable fiction - particularly fiction set in the mid-20th century.  The ultimate compliment: when I finished this I did not hesitate to pick up Wouk's sequel, War and Remembrance.  Awesome!</td></tr><tr><td>The lyrical rhymes and magic of everyday kid's lives is captivating for even young children. I grew up listening to these poems and my kids have enjoyed them, too. I am particularly fond of the illustrations by Eloise Wilkin. She captures the realism of both landscape and children's faces. This is a timeless classic.</td></tr><tr><td>Elmore Leonard is a very good story teller, much like his mentor, Ernest Hemingway. This is an excellent story, quick, clean and very cinematic. If you like westerns, get it.</td></tr><tr><td>Like Fitzhugh's first novel 'Pest Control', Organ Grinders brings together a wonderful cast of characters that'll leave you in stitches. And this story takes so many unbelievable turns you'll want to finish in one  sitting. The good guys triumph. The bad guys die. And the cute little  baboon 'Clyde' will put a smile on anyone's face. The ending is a bit  predictable, and possibly too \"ride off in the sunset\" for some,  but it's a great story and getting there IS half the fun.</td></tr><tr><td>Love to become so engrossed in a book- Winston Graham has a way with words that are so beautiful.</td></tr><tr><td>I have to confess that I bought the book because of the cute title. I expected it to be humorous. I was wrong. This collection of short stories about life on the reservation was so depressing that I could hardly finish it. The author is famous, and each story is well-crafted. However, each one is sad. Do Indians ever have a happy ending?</td></tr><tr><td>This is one exciting series. The action and little bit of romance are part of the plot. Th way the author writes you feel like you are there.</td></tr><tr><td>Fool's Assassin by Robin Hobb is the first novel in Hobb's Fitz and the Fool series, her latest to tell the ongoing story of her beloved character, FitzChivalry Farseer. Hobb began Fitz's journey many books and series ago when the character was a child. All throughout, Fitz has built relationships, made enemies, served his king, loved and lost, and, above all, made nearly every sacrifice imaginable. It's been a long, hard road for the bastard son of Chivalry Farseer, but one that I can say with great relief isn't over yet. Fool's Assassin picks up not terribly long after Fool's Fate. Fitz has settled into his persona as Tom Badgerlock, holder for the lands of his daughter, Nettle. Because of his past (and everyone thinking he's dead), Fitz must maintain this false identity for his own good and the good of the Farseers. Far from being resentful of it, Fitz has embraced the life of a holder since it keeps him far from the court intrigue and politics so prevalent in Buckkeep Castle. Even better, Fitz has been reunited with the love of his life, Molly, who now resides with him at Withywoods, where they lead an idyllic life. It would seem Fitz, who has sacrificed so much, has finally earned the quiet life he has wanted for so long. That, in fact, how we find Fitz and Molly getting on for nearly the first half of the book. True to the author's style, Hobb moves us along very slowly. Longtime fans will not be surprised by this at all. It's a testament to Hobb's skill as a writer, though, that even sans many of the plot devices other authors dangle in front of readers to keep their attention, she is able to maintain the reader's interest over hundreds of pages while slowly doling out bits and pieces of the larger story to come. When the end of this first novel in the Fitz and Fool trilogy does come, it comes fast. It left me deeply interested in what's to come next for Fitz as he is finally reunited with his longtime friend, the Fool. I will freely admit bias when reviewing anything penned by Robin Hobb as she has long been a favorite author of mine. Not that I've embraced everything she's ever written, but I, like so many other readers, has been on Fitz's journey for so long that I doubt there's any story she could tell about him that I didn't find of interest. Even still, Fool's Assassin earned a rating of three rockets. I would have given it four if only Hobb had cut to the chase a bit and gotten to the real story sooner.</td></tr><tr><td>I just love this book.  It is a wild rollercoaster ride, remniscent (though very different from) Catch-22.  Three siblings, each more crazy than the other.  Great satirical parts, the takeoff on Manhattan's hyperexpensive grocery stores was priceless.  And the seemingly normal brother and his arguments with his wife ring so true.  One tidbit:  the book starts and ends (in a sense) with pressures over which family members will join their parents for Christmas ... and this starts in March.</td></tr><tr><td>required reading for my son, he thought it was boring</td></tr><tr><td>I like how this board book unfolds so it can sit up during tummy time, but the images just don't hold the attention of my 2-month old. He seems to enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Look-Look/dp/B002CL98LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Look, Look!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hello-Animals-Black-and-White-Sparklers/dp/1589258614/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hello, Animals!

Was very surprised by the way it ended & I'm looking forward to reading part of this book.......</td></tr><tr><td>This book was excellently written and I sat down and read it all at one time. I especially enjoyed the history that was put forth in this book and I would recommend anyone to read it.  Thanks to the author for doing such a wonderful job and making my day very enjoyable with this read.</td></tr><tr><td>First, I want to say that this bird book represents a fine overall effort by its author, editors, designer, photographers, devisors of range maps, and other contributors. While it has clear limitations as a field guide, it's still an excellent reference for birdwatchers. I need to provide some background here so that folks will better understand my comments regarding this new 2008 birding field guide. Field guides are used by nature lovers and natural resource professionals mostly to IDENTIFY birds, wildflowers, rocks and minerals, reptiles, trees, and any number of other creatures, plants, and non-living objects found in our natural environment. In regard to birds there are hundreds of available field guides but their numbers shrink as one either limits the geographical area that they cover, or, as the number of species in such guides expand, (e.g., from \"Hawks of the U.S.\" to \"Birds of the U.S.\"). In this instance we have a birder's field guide which covers all species found in the United States (including Alaska) and Canada. So, there are really only three other field guides which closely rival the instant one and they are&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Sibley-Guide-to-Birds/dp/0679451226/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sibley Guide to Birds</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/National-Geographic-Field-Guide-To-The-Birds-Of-North-America-4th-Edition/dp/0792268776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">National Geographic Field Guide To The Birds Of North America, 4th Edition</a>, and,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Peterson-Field-Guide-to-Birds-of-North-America-Peterson-Field-Guides-R/dp/0618966145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Peterson Field Guide to Birds of North America (Peterson Field Guides(R))</a>. (I don't mention&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-Guide-to-Field-Identification-Birds-of-North-America/dp/B000KK07KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America</a>&nbsp;[\"Golden Field Guide\"] because it offers very limited information). This is not to say that I use the large Sibley guide while I'm out on bird hikes - I don't because it's too bulky. The National Geographic guide is just small enough to carry in the field as is the Peterson guide but, again, they offer limited information, (which is okay if all you want to do is IDENTIFY the birds). The Smithsonian guide suffers from the same perplexing size and weight problem as the large Sibley guide, albeit the former is actually 12 percent smaller than Sibley (I refer to the \"large\" Sibley guide because it is now also available in essentially an \"eastern\" and a \"western\" version.) Both my wife and I have been active birdwatchers for many years (her science is far superior to mine!) and we own every available birding field guide for our regions of study and duplicates of some. After hundreds of hikes, camping trips, and other bird outings, I'm pretty aware of the likes and dislikes of birders concerning field guides. The one conclusion that most of us share is that a field guide should be COMPACT and LIGHT so it can be comfortably carried in a large pocket. To achieve this we now know that field guides should be split into two volumes: Eastern U.S. and Canada, and, Western U.S. and Canada. One does not need a western guide for birding in say, Pennsylvania, so why deal with the excess bulk? That's what we'll be doing when we carry either the large Sibley guide or this one into the woods or marsh. The large Sibley Guide weighs 2  pounds. The Smithsonian Guide weighs 2 pounds (I weighed them both on accurate culinary scales). That's slightly too much for comfort in the field even if your pocket is big enough. Hearty souls might carry the Smithsonian guide in a day pack or, in a new and innovative piece of birding attire called \"Big Pockets\". The outer dimensions of The Smithsonian Guide are: 8\" x 6\" x 1 \". Which field guides DO I see during outings of experienced birders? In addition to the large Sibley guide, there are only four which are used 98% of the time: <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-Field-Guide-to-the-Birds-of-Eastern-and-Central-North-America/dp/0395740460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Field Guide to the Birds of Eastern and Central North America</a> (Peterson, essentially divided into two separate volumes, \"eastern\" and \"western\") <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Sibley-Field-Guide-to-Birds-of-Eastern-North-America/dp/067945120X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Eastern North America</a> (divided into two separate volumes, eastern\" and \"western\") <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/National-Geographic-Field-Guide-To-The-Birds-Of-North-America-4th-Edition/dp/0792268776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">National Geographic Field Guide To The Birds Of North America, 4th Edition</a> <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/A-Guide-to-Field-Identification-Birds-of-North-America/dp/B000KK07KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America</a> (\"Golden Field Guide\") I use The Peterson Field Guide and my wife uses the National Geographic Field Guide. I think that many of us have stayed with the Peterson guide for no better reason than the fact that it's been a real workhorse and a good friend over many years of hobbyist birding. However, we always carry the large Sibley guide in the car as a back-up reference and now, we will additionally be carrying along the Smithsonian Field Guide. And here's a good place to point out the unique Hallmark Feature of the Smithsonian Field Guide: IT HAS INCORPORATED ACTUAL PHOTOS OF ALL THE BIRDS! All the others rely solely on artwork of the birds so having actual photos is going to be a great advantage and probably offers the chief reason as to why folks should keep it close at hand on birding trips. Here are my criteria for selecting a birding field guide. I have also rendered the \"answers\" as to how the Smithsonian Field Guide fits into these criteria: 1. size (will it fit in a large pocket or daypack?) - daypack, but not cargo pants pockets. 2. photos, art (color?), or line drawings? - actual photographs, from 1-5 photos per species. 3. quality of bird descriptions - superb! 4. illustrated \"field marks\" included? (these are little marks on the drawings to direct the birder's attention to significant nuances of each bird species' appearance) - no. 5. are both Spring and Fall plumages illustrated? (most important with warbler species and certain shorebirds) - not very much. 6. juvenile birds illustrated? - quite a bit, especially where it's important. 7. font size and type (straight-forward and big enough to read easily?) - a little dicey but readable. 8. binding types (softcover versions are always best in the field) - softcover. 9. credentials of the author(s)/illustrator(s) - superb. 10. water resistant/waterproof binding and/or pages? - yes. 11. pleasing format/layout? (this varies widely from guide to guide and is subjective from one person to another). - yes, quite usable and pleasing, not confusing. 12. terminology (technical or common terminology?) - anyone can understand, plus book includes a glossary of terms. 13. range maps included? (very important for new birders!) - yes, including winter, year-round, breeding, migration, and \"rare\" range maps. 14. migration route maps included? - refer to regular range maps. 15. a \"fast\" index? (this is difficult to determine in advance because it's a subjective evaluation, varying with individuals -- this involves how fast one can locate a bird drawing/description, utilizing the index to refer to the page on which it is featured) - yes, and it includes a second \"quick index\" which is a very nice feature. 16. price? (the least important consideration) - very reasonable for the high quality of this publication. No field guide offers the \"best of everything\" for two specific reasons: 1. The book would become a tome which, in itself, would totally disqualify it as a field guide. Remember, the first purpose of any field guide is to help the user to IDENTIFY something - so, you don't need a \"life history\" or any other field use impedimenta. 2. No two birders could ever agree on what is \"best\"! The Smithsonian Field Guide also features a birder's checklist (life-list, in the back of the book) which can be maintained as one \"collects\" sightings of each species. Also, secured inside the rear cover is a \"birdsong DVD\" which will be equally useful to experienced birders and to newbies of this great pastime as well. Be advised that if your DVD player represents older technology (as mine does) this disc will read out as \"incompatible\" with your player. My five year-old computer rejected it as well. A final nice feature of the Smithsonian guide is that each bird's status is noted by the ABA coding system, a device for conveying chiefly the abundance of any particular bird. I don't recall seeing this caveat in any other field guide, albeit, in a few years this feature will render the book out-of-date as the status of individual bird species change. My career has been that of a State Park Ranger, State Game Protector, Federal Game Warden, and Instructor of Natural Resources at the local university. As a consequence of that professional exposure, in addition to my numerous informal bird outings, I have met hundreds of great birders and have had the singular privilege of discussing the frequent topic of field guides with them. Other than binoculars, no piece of equipment or accessory is more important to a birder than his or her field guide. In summary, I award&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Smithsonian-Field-Guide-to-the-Birds-of-North-America/dp/0061120405/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smithsonian Field Guide to the Birds of North America</a>&nbsp;my highest recommendation to accommodate experienced birders who would like to carry this guide in the car (or in a daypack); to people who would love a superior guide for identifying birds at their home feeders or as they vacation the beach, and; to both new and experienced birders who will find the beautiful photographs to be indispensable in identifying birds.</td></tr><tr><td>If you are a Kindle user, have no concerns about purchasing the Kindle edition of this classic work on faith by Paul Tillich. The Kindle formatting is perfect and comes with an active table of contents. It was a nice replacement for my original paperback copy which I bought years and years ago and which is now falling apart (literally) at the seams. \"Faith is the state of ultimate concern.\"</td></tr><tr><td>Not a fan of the book. Historical perspective was well done but story was weak. Don't recommend the book to anyone</td></tr><tr><td>The book is a great spy story as well well easy reading. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter is 11, and my son is 7.  They both request to listen to books from this series.  The narrator is a perfect choice.  She brings the story alive.</td></tr><tr><td>Pete's a pizza is, for me, an old classic. Readers will love the content and BEG to be made into pizzas themselves! I strongly suggest parents pre-read this book before presenting it to their child for the first time. Why? Because you'll want to have your supplies ready to make your child into a pizza, too! Even if you opt NOT to recreate this book, you and your child will still absolutely LOVE it! Pete is a crabby little boy who just wants to play outside. To take Pete's mind off of things, his father decides to turn Pete into a pizza. This is a great book to drag out when you are finding that your children are having a hard time handling frustration when things do not go their way. It helps reinforce to children that they can make the best out of a situation that does not go their way. It also provides a lot of comedic relief and gets children interested in reading!</td></tr><tr><td>Through my childhood I watched the MGM Wizard of Oz movie dozens of times.  I think I may have seen part of an animated version at some time as well.  My mom had copies of the various Oz books around the house and I thumbed through a couple of them to look at the strange illustrations from time to time but I never bothered to actually read any of them.  So I finally decided it was time to take a literary trip into Oz. Going in, I knew there were going to be differences from the movie.  That's to be expected.  I'd been told once long ago that Dorothy's magic slippers were silver in the book and not ruby and that the choice of silver was some social commentary on the plight of the poor or something.  But I was surprised at the vast number of differences as I started reading.  The first difference was the fact that so little happened in Kansas before Dorothy was swept away to Oz.  There's no scene of Dorothy pining for something more...for some land over the rainbow.  There's no interaction with various farm hands or with a crotchety neighbor lady who especially dislikes Toto.  Instead, we get a drab description of the bleak Kansas landscape and then the next thing we know, the house is being lifted away with Dorothy inside. Once in Oz the differences from the movie just compound.  It seems that MGM must have thought that the book had too many characters and adventures.  In the book, Dorothy actually interacts with all 4 of the witches of Oz and through her journey she passes through a bunch of different villages and locations meeting many various inhabitants of the land. Part of me kept anticipating moments from the movie and felt a little disappointed when they didn't happen the way I remember from my childhood.  But a larger part of me really enjoyed the depth and variety in the book. Baum has created a very unique world in the land of Oz.  In the movie, we only get to know a few of the inhabitants and only superficially at that.  Even though the book is fairly short, we actually get to know quite a few of the denizens of Oz and learn that this place is really very unique.  The descriptions and adventures really make Oz a very compelling world.  Not having read the book, I was a little skeptical that there would be enough material to warrant the ~dozen sequels.  But now that I've read this first one and gotten a feel for Baum's style and creativity, I am really quite excited to read some of the other adventures of  Oz and see what else he has in store. If, like me, you or your kids haven't read the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, you should give it a try.  It's a fun whimsical book that's really enjoyable. **** 4 out of 5 stars</td></tr><tr><td>Love this book. I mean my grandson and the little boy I watch love this book.</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, I must mention that I only read this book because it was a free Kindle selection.  That being said, this book leaves much to be desired. First of all, this is most decidedly not a romance. The characters' relationship in this story is secondary to the adventure, and the relationship isn't even a great one. Secondly, the book could use some editing with a machete - it was far too long. I'm giving it three stars instead of one or two because the prose itself was good, and the story was entertaining and obviously well-researched.</td></tr><tr><td>We were brought up on these delightful and funny poems in our elementary school outside of Chicago. I will treasure them forever as they gave me an excellent reading foundation and sparked my interest in poetry. Excellent teaching tool.</td></tr><tr><td>Laugh Out Loud and learn about Australia at the same time.  This travel guide is, like others Bryson has written, is the most enjoyable way to get a feel for the country and it's people.  Bill's self deprecating style and sharp insights make this a very satisfying read.  Enjoy!</td></tr><tr><td>I loved reading this series, but was disappointed on how the ending turned out. It had some great moments and some okay moments. So much build up and did not have the ending i hoped for.  But overall a good book to read.</td></tr><tr><td>Fun read that isn't too long. Captures the soul of yester year. It's my first book by this author and I think I'll read more of his books on the future.</td></tr><tr><td>book for class. Arrived early and is actually quite interesting.</td></tr><tr><td>Classic for young children.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book with some really good insight.  I was hoping for a little more analysis from the sociological aspect of working class.  However,  a really great introduction to the topic of the working class</td></tr><tr><td>In the first volume, the idea of the effects of environment on good and evil, relative to the cultural meaning of these terms and their effects on the developing young  were explored.  One delved deeply into the nature of good and evil and how we resolve the conflicts in our nature and develop into a \"good\" person or an \"evil\" person.  There were present in that book, equally interesting starts on exploring analogous types of gender issues.  This second volume splendidly investigates these latter rather disturbing issues, as well as some other disturbing aspects of growing up in one's community, away from \"school\".  These first two volumes presented quite novel perspectives on \"fairy tales\" in developing a fairy tale.  There are unresolved problems left at the end of the book about the basic control and direction of a young life, as people set courses toward adulthood, and encounter subtle (and not so subtle) forces of control in the world that influence the nave young.  This certainly encourages one to read the next book in the series.  While directed toward the young, I found these two volumes to be quite interesting and thought-provoking for an older person such as myself.  I strongly recommend reading these first two volumes:  Excellent!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great series of three books (hopefully more to come).  I've read them to my 10 year old son as part of our bedtime routine and he is so disappointed when we stop each evening.  I've needed to lock his Kindle lest he read ahead.  The story follows a young man named Logan as he adapts to a new school and the loss of his mother.  Being the new kid in a rural setting, he tries to make friends but it's hard.  Suddenly he is thrust into a world of mythical creatures and finds out things about himself and his mother that turn his life on its ear.  This is a book that your kids will love (honestly it's hard for me not to read ahead myself).</td></tr><tr><td>A Share in Death is the first book in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series. I chose to read this book due to recommendations from mystery readers. Duncan Kincaid is on a holiday from Scotland Yard. His cousin has offered him a stay at his time share in Yorkshire. Duncan looks forward to just relaxing and does not let fellow vacationers know his profession. That soon changes when a murder happens after Duncan checks in. The murder in not in Duncan's jurisdiction and the head local investigator resents Duncan looking in on the crime. The suspects are time share vacationers plus the management of the time share facilities. In this first introduction to Duncan, he is very capable and likable. His partner Gemma does investigation in the neighborhoods of the suspects. It was a good mystery due to all all the suspects and plotting.  I would think I had it figured out and then would change my mind that is was another suspect who committed the murders. There was a twist in the story. I am looking forward to reading more in the series and catching up with Duncan's and Gemma's lives. This was a very enjoyable read.</td></tr><tr><td>Used it for an advanced ESL class, discovered it had tons of word groups:  wood, woods, trunk, branch, root, chop, axe, was one group you'd expect to find reading about life in a forest!  Another was about butchering, preserving food, etc.  It was dense information for my students, I'd rethink presentation next time.  One of my favorite books for it's description and cataloguing of life in the woods.</td></tr><tr><td>Great story.  Series of cultural heritage mixed with mystery and investigation is ever appealing.  This series is one I  highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>Went into WAY to much detail on unnecessary and uninteresting facts about people and places that were not needed in order to tell the story.  Hard to keep the pages open when an author does this.</td></tr><tr><td>Why not in US? Release in US the kindle versions of this series.</td></tr><tr><td>Fascinating!  Very well written.  I enjoyed it immensely.</td></tr><tr><td>One of the most insightful books written as a result of the eighteenth century enlightenment.  It was a strong influence on the American revolution and a contributing factor for the French Revolution.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good overview, and interesting read, that leads to the understanding of other cultures and their values. I definitely recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely loved the beginning! I enjoyed the flashbacks that give us more insight into Alexander's story before he and Tatiana meet in the first book. Even though they are apart, I still enjoy the love story that is Tatiana and Alexander! The middle left me frustrated. It tended to drag on and make me wonder what kind of love story would spend hundreds of pages on everything but ROMANCE. I seriously wanted to claw Tatiana's eyes out every time she contemplated dropping her son off with the nearest stranger or putting a bullet through her head. If she even remotely believed that Alexander was dead, what reason did she have to live?? Apparently their son was not reason enough?? Once Tatiana snapped out of her \"woe is me\" mode towards the end, it was fantastic. Overall, I still enjoyed the story despite my issues with Tatiana's character.</td></tr><tr><td>I was very disappointed in the way the last book of this series ended. It left so many issues and characters unresolved. There was no finality to the entire story. i read all five of the books. There has to be a follow up that ties up all the lose ends. Personally I did not like tha fact that every character I became attached to was killed off. I was throroughly engrossed in the the epic story telling, but extremely let down at the ending.</td></tr><tr><td>This book took me almost 3 months to finish, including a 3 or 4 week hiatus during which I'd decided not to finish it (something I rarely do).  Since I normally read 4 - 6 books a month, that's a telling bit of information. A nagging idea that I *should* finish the book resulted in my working through it. This work is tedious, no way around it. The author seems to believe that every detail he's uncovered (the street address of Schulz's first wife's parents, for example) is worth divulging.  At times, the book also seemed to be a retelling of tales from one aggrieved party or another.  There were even some anachronistic mistakes in the volume I read, including the revelation that Schulz and a companion engaged in a discussion while drinking Diet Cokes in April 1970 (p. 452).  Diet Coke was not introduced until 1982.  A minor error to be sure, but if the author cares enough to tell us what is being drunk, he should get it right.  It also makes me open to doubt the accuracy of the rest of the book. Several other parts of the book annoyed me.  One was the author's use of Peanuts strips to make a point.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  Also, on more than one occasion, the author described a certain strip, quoted the dialog, and then printed the strip.  And I have to mention the psychoanalysis of Schulz the author indulged in during the latter part of the book.  I'm not sure he's qualified to perform psychoanalysis, and I frequently found myself slapping my forehead while muttering, \"Jeez! Enough already!.\" On the positive side, the book made me think, and continues to do so.  Even though I finished it three weeks before writing this review, I still find myself thinking about Schulz's purported dislike of leaving home for any sort of travel.  More importantly, though, I've come to clearly realize that one must appreciate an artist's (or entertainer's) *work* and not concern oneself with their conduct, character or private life.  While this has been something I've instinctively felt for quite a while, reading this book really hit the point home. I really can't recommend buying the book, but if you already have it, work your way through it.  If nothing else, some of the strips were new to me and I thought I'd read them all.</td></tr><tr><td>Just as described, arrived quickly, very happy with product.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this years ago and now have read it again.  The writer made her life come alive as she and her husband mastered the wilderness and the odd neighbors, showing everyone has something to offer.  So frank and forthright.</td></tr><tr><td>This one has the usual traditional characters: organized crime, corrupt politicians, corrupt judges, corrupt police, newspaper reporter, the poor, tough and flawed private investigator and all the outside resources a hardened PI would need, absent an armorer.  But for all that is stereotypical, the characters aren't and the way they interact is realistic.  No superpeople.  The writing's smooth, the plot keeps moving.  You may not \"like\" any of the characters; you'll understand them more-or-less, but they're not a friendly or sympathetic bunch.  Everyone's looking out for number one.  Don't expect humor. This is a very conventional, throwback crime novel.  It's almost obsolete with the radical changes in the number of groups building businesses on criminal activity.  At one point things seemed to bog down a bit with the description and interaction within the criminal organization, but it moved on. If you're fond of the genre this is a good one.</td></tr><tr><td>A terrific book. Very entertaining while being very informative as well.</td></tr><tr><td>I've probably read all of Dick Francis' many books and always await the next one happily.  In between the advent of his new books, I occasionally re-read some old ones with pleasure, which I rarely do except in the case of classics.  He writes literature equaling, for example, Eric Ambler's writing in quality.</td></tr><tr><td>I have been a fan of Koontz for years and have enjoyed his books. However, I bought this book as a present for my brother and haven't had a chance to borrow and read it. I am sure I will enjoy it when I finall turn the pages.</td></tr><tr><td>There's a decent story submerged in this book, but it's utterly swamped by the narrator's endless didactic asides on whales and whaling. For every page about Ahab's obsessive quest or Ishmael and Queequeg's sweet friendship or even the fate of minor characters like poor Pip, readers are subjected to two or three pages of nautical background information that adds little to the tale at hand. I liked the narrative on the rare occasion it surfaced, but the reading experience too closely mirrored the long periods of boredom accompanying an actual hunt at sea.</td></tr><tr><td>Well written suspense/thriller novel.  Interesting group of characters and a great plot twist at the end!  Enjoyed reading this page turner!</td></tr><tr><td>I am currently in therapy and try to read what I can on this subject.  This book has been absolutely the best and most helpful and highly recommend. My sweet 21 year old only daughter who was still living with us while attending a local college, became hostile towards us when she started dating a guy in a nearby town she met online and he wanted her out of her parents house. She left and was estranged for 6 months, and since some communication started again, my daughter has written revenge texts about my parenting, her childhood, etc.  THIS book talks about this exact scenario in a totally appreciative manner that doenst leave you feeling hopeless. If you don't want to be that bitter, old woman or man, sitting in a chair all alone someday in your 80's because you protected your ego over everything possible then I suggest you read this book.  It helped me feel so much better about my future and letting her go and leaving her choices to her.  But also not to be continually abused by an adult child and to find your life.  Remember we all had a life before we had them, right?!! Being a parent was my job for so long and ingrained in me so has been very difficult to change, and very painful.  I have had moments of complete bawling and crying out, to just tearing up in conversations with friends.  It's Christmas time while I write this, and while shopping for groceries I had to stop in the aisle, plug my ears for several minutes as a Celine Dion Christmas song came on overhead that was my daughter's and I favorite Christmas song.  People probably thought I was off, but if I unplugged my ears for a second I would bawl.  More than half my hair has fallen out from the original shock of losing her.  It truly is very much like a death and you very much go through the same grief if not worse because you know they are still out there and don't want anything to do with you.  She was the lucky one getting out of this home where I am stuck with all the memories of the past 22 years.  The property was literally built around her as she grew up and everything a memory. I truly enjoyed raising my daughter and wallowed in every moment.  She and I were extremely close and never would've thought this could happen in a million years. But at the same I was overwhelmed and my marriage had issues and there where times where my stress resulted in anger and yelling between my husband and I and of course the daughter caught in the dysfunction. You just have to recognize no one is perfect nor the perfect parent.  This book will explain this to you. I am still not reconnected completely with my daughter, we've seen each other a few times, some of it good, some of it went bad.  She is living with the guy, but this book has given me ideas and a plan to fight for her and have her in my life again.  To accept.  To live for myself.  I don't want to be that old lady in a chair petting a cat as my only company.  I want my daughter in my life and will do what it takes to atleast try..  Thank you Dr. Coleman for this book.  I wish you had more reading materials to buy here.  This book is brilliant and you have so much to offer all of us!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a travelogue in the spirit of The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls.  Our tour guide is James Donald/David Bowman/Hamel/Vance (the names reflecting the revolving door of fathers in the authors life).  Writing his memoir at the tender age of thirty-one, Vance takes us from his birth into a family of Kentucky hillbillies transplanted to Middleton, Ohio, to his unlikely graduation from Yale Law School.  His embrace of two conflicting cultures (hes a hillbilly at heart whos learned to eat dinner with multiple forks) enables him to write about his kinfolk with an honesty that is unswervingly critical and warmly generous in the same breath.  He writes for readers in the multiple-fork culture.  He wants us to understand, he says, the psychological impactof spiritual and material poverty; he wants us to understand how the American Dream looks to people in the holler;  he wants us to understand that for himself and others who were lucky enough to live the American Dream, the demons of the life we left behind continue to chase us.  Few will come away from this book without an enlarged sensibility toward a band of foreigners who might live no more than a stones throw down the road.</td></tr><tr><td>This epic tale of Georgia during and after the Civil war is quite possibly one of the best literary works I've ever read. It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time. I'm so glad to have read it.</td></tr><tr><td>Great reading.</td></tr><tr><td>I was sorry to see this one end. With every Discworld book I fall in love with a different character. This time it was the librarian. Like all good and brave librarians, he stopped a  book  burning. Hooray for librarians.</td></tr><tr><td>If I could rate it 6 stars I would. This is a great book about Sammy 'the Bull'. It is written honestly and doesn't mince words. This is a real account told from a brazenly truthful Gravano. You won't regret reading this book!</td></tr><tr><td>Very moving...I cried most of the time. I pray this type of treatment never happens again but I know it will as humans can be cruel when even the smallest amount of power is given.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book on an airplane and I cried openly.  I felt so lucky to have a chance to look across time and space into this imtimate view of a girl growing up at the turn of the century, based on a real person.  I  found the use of capitalization absolutely perfect in conveying the not  only the meaning of the text but the emotional impact and the way May  Amelia was internalizing what is being said to her.  The present tense only  made the perceptions more immediate, and I think all together the author's  choices were extremely effective in successfully creating a true time  travel experience for the reader.  There were many characters, boys and  girls, and they all were very distinctive.  I would hate to think any girl  coming of age would miss out on the chance to know May Amelia just because  some people are sticklers for more traditional format, since this book  really lights up the shelves of children's literature and I can't wait to  read it out loud to as many kids as will listen.  To the other reviewer:  yes, Zachary Beaver is terrific, and I do agree that the National Book  Award has promoted some sensational children's literature that surely  rivals the Newbery, but there's no need to read one instead of the other.  Let's be glad there are more forums to recognize the best of the best!  I'll wager time will prove that Our Only May Amelia is among the more  enduring and beloved female protagonists from the turn of OUR century!  P.S. if you like this book, try The Birchbark House by Louise Erdrich,  you'll like it, too!</td></tr><tr><td>I don't like Hillerman novels.  It was chosen for our book club. .</td></tr><tr><td>What a great book. If you want suspense you got it, if you want things that like to eat you and other outlandish things then this is the book for you. Warren Fahy is a good author. Does a person know that there are probably islands out somewhere that have never been explored.,or under the water. But there's probably another book somewhere. Read this book for a good thrill ride.</td></tr><tr><td>Engrossing, riveting, and much more complete than the movie.....which books usually are.  It was a good reminder of what truly happened to our POWs during WWII and all those men had to endure, not only during the war but after.  It's easy to forget since we are now we are allies with Japan.  Louie's ability to endure that much pain and later be able to not only receive, but also embrace and pass on God's grace to the men who were so inhumane and cruel is inspiring.  The author has written in a way that makes the story flow seamlessly.  Too many times biographies seem choppy.  Unbroken is written in a way that makes you feel submerged in the story...like you are living it also...a sort of silent witness to events, thoughts, and emotions.  A wonderful, inspiring story I am sure to read again.</td></tr><tr><td>As an ex-teacher librarian I have always loved this author and series.  But have never owned them.  So a treat to buy them in one book.</td></tr><tr><td>Another great Baldacci book...he's my favorite author...always enjoyable</td></tr><tr><td>I knew nothing about this book or this writer...nothing not even a word...not even how to pronounce her name(sigh). Ah so good to have read like this, to know you are not be reading a book that would fall off by the end. This should be on everyone's mind and list to read. Ir should be on a  required reading list in the sky list!  The denseness of thoughts thoroughout the book are mind charging!  I cherish my  experience!</td></tr><tr><td>This is my favorite Elmore Leonard book to date.  now, i  have only read three of his books, but I find comic crime novels to not be that interesting.  However, I loved the movie and that that I should try the book.  The book lived up to the hype.  It had a movement that just flowed off the pages.  The characters were well rounded, interesting and funny.  You really felt the connection between Jack Foley and Karen Sisco, even though one was a bank robber and escaped convict and the other was a US Marshal.  If you read just one Elmore Leonard book, read Out of Sight.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was a great read.  I thought that there was the right time spent on the right things.  I highly recommend this book for those that are interested in diving.</td></tr><tr><td>This Saxon series is winding down, but apparently Bernard Cornwell doesn't realize it. The first couple of books (one of which has been adapted for TV and given new life to the series) were more straightforward and left the reader with a sense of reaching a goal. This latest addition just feels like filler to get us to the next book. There are fights, for sure, but honestly: nothing of consequence happens here that couldn't have been summed up in a few pages. It has been a couple of years since I read the last installment, so to be honest, I had lost the thread of the narrative. The fact that several characters have names which are confusingly similar (male and female), or even identical, doesn't help the reader latch on. I would NEVER recommend this book to someone who hadn't read all the previous books, preferably recently. And as I complained in an earlier review, Uhtred's never-ending stream of invective against the Christian God is now just a predictable annoyance. I just finished this the other night and all I remember distinctly is a couple of swords and lots of pus. Not a high recommendation. I should also mention my ongoing tirade against Cornwell's annoying quirk of ending every chapter and section with a short contrived sentence. Did he do it again in this book. Yes, he did.</td></tr><tr><td>Worth a person's time to get through the first chapter. Then you're off on quite an adventure!  It is worth going \"There and Back Again.\"  Enjoy the ride!</td></tr><tr><td>Came by chance upon this book, in the 70s, early in my life. It is my secular bible.  Certainly it changed my life, absolutely and for the better.  Was fortunate to hear him speak on several occasions and spoke to him about his concepts.  He was a charming, eloquent, thoughtful man who realised that we had one life which was a pity to allow to waste.  Believe in yourself.  Rely on yourself, a sovereign individual.  Having done that, it is then possible to become a happy, fulfilled, useful member of society.  I often dip into it and read just a few pages to refresh and rekindle my ideas and dreams. To me it is worth countless stars.  Have just bought copies for my children.  Still not prepared to part with mine for them.</td></tr><tr><td>It was pleasant reading, but for in order to give it 5 stars I would need to be unable to put it down !!!</td></tr><tr><td>One of the most captivating and informative mysteries I have read. I really enjoyed learning of the different customs and sayings of the Chinese culture and how long they have lasted through time</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this book</td></tr><tr><td>Awesome Idea was given to me and I found the book to very good.</td></tr><tr><td>'First Drop of Crimson' is a spin off novel in the Night Huntress series (which focused on Cat and Bones) but was a really good read in its own right. As the book starts we meet Denise MacGregor, a woman who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder following events a year before when her husband was killed by a group of vampires. The whole idea of vampires and death and blood is too much for Denise and she has withdrawn from her friendship with Cat (a half-vampire) and is trying to go about her life, recovering from her husband's death, away from supernatural creatures. But one of Denise's cousins tells her he believes his family are being killed - and when he is next, Denise realises something is going on. She meets Raum, the demon responsible for the deaths, and has to make a bargain with him for her life and that of her family. She needs to find one of her relatives, Nathaniel, but doesn't know how to go about it without involving Cat and Bones. But then she remembers Spade, one of the other vampires, and contacts him. Spade isn't interested in humans but finds himself agreeing to help Denise. He gets more than he bargained for, finding something about her that draws him, and also discovering the seriousness of her situation. Can they together find Nathaniel? Can they keep each other safe? I enjoyed this book whilst reading it, finding it always interesting and not particularly predictable. The setting moved from America to England to Monaco and more, although the author doesn't particularly spend time setting the scene and aiming for authenticity. In fact, our English hero speaks in a rather odd way at times (he seems to use 'quid' as a synonym for 'money' where it doesn't work in English most of the time), and the principality of Monaco seems to have been elevated to the status of an island, but these are minor niggles in what was overall a good story. I thought the cover was dreadful but this is par for the course in this kind of book, but Denise and Spade were both good characters and I enjoyed reading their romance. Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book  Helen Hancox 2010</td></tr><tr><td>Very good watched the movie but of course book was better. As combat veteran I understand the reason for wanting to go back.</td></tr><tr><td>the ONLY thing I didn't like about this book was Martin's choice to only focus on about half of the characters, leaving the other characters' stories for book 5, A Dance with Dragons.</td></tr><tr><td>A must read for those who have read the first two books of the Divergent series. The lead characters must battle to survive.</td></tr><tr><td>This story of a Tokyo dilettante (overused, but still best describes him), his country Geisha mistress and a mysterious young woman is considered one of the great works of Japanese nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata.  The title describes the nature of the mountain setting of the story, but could also tells of the nature of the relationships involved.  The It is classic Japanese in highlighting the ephemeral nature of life and relationships.  In another sense, the writer calls memories of Hemingway, as the prose is minimalist.  Conversation is tight, and much has to be interpreted. Complaints have been made of the nature of the translation.  I am certainly no expert.  There is repetition of words, but perhaps that is symptomatic of the original.  The message of the story still comes through.  Kawabata must have been somewhat happy with his translator - he brought him to translate the Nobel speech as well.  I certainly haven't \"gotten\" the entire story yet, but I think the fault lies in this reader, and not the translator.</td></tr><tr><td>I missed his work for the past 5 years, and was/am happy for his return. I worried in the beginning of the book, as it was a bit of a slow start.  However, he delivered a very good story; I needn't have worried.  I don't do lengthy plot reviews, there are many who do that for you.  The price on this book was unbelievable, and worth a heck of a lot more than I paid: $1.99. As usual, Mr. Iles gives you your $$ worth and more.  This is a very good, well-written, thoroughly edited, professional read. Good characterizations, an interesting plot.  You can't miss on this one. 4.5 Stars.</td></tr><tr><td>I did this book at a all men's bookclub.  They loved it.  They could relate to the issues that Toby/Jack went thru. I thought that even though it took place in the 50's/60's it was definitely relevant to today & what families & children go thru.</td></tr><tr><td>Well Written.  I enjoyed very much.</td></tr><tr><td>Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \"Little Women\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \"Little Women\" come alive. The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \"poor little rich boy\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety. The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well. There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \"Little Women.\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \"scribbling\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true. Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \"Little Women\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike. Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \"heartwarming\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on. Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \"perfect little homemaker\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo. \"Little Women\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor. And  Austen's \"The Complete Novels\" brings together the full complement of Austen's finished novels, from the little-known \"Lady Susan\" to the classic bestseller \"Pride and Prejudice\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories. \"Pride and Prejudice\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \"Sense and Sensibility\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable. Anne Elliott has a problem with \"Persuasion,\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \"Mansfield Park\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park. And \"Northanger Abbey\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \"Emma\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \"Lady Susan,\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff. The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \"Lady Susan,\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family). And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \"Lady Susan\" and \"Persuasion,\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\"). Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie). Jane Austen's \"Complete Novels\" draws together all her major finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.</td></tr><tr><td>Gayle Brandeis's debut novel, winner of the Bellwether Prize for Fiction, is a mistily vivid story that unfolds like a flower. Drawing on the complicated mother-daughter relationships, it's a haunting and delicately-drawn story. Ava Sing Lo, the child of a Korean immigrant and an African-American GI, has been accidently killing her mother's birds since she was small. After graduating from college, Ava is directionless, aimless, lonely and not feeling at home anywhere. In an effort to make up for her accidental bird-killings, she volunteers to help save sick birds on the Salton Sea. While there, she is reminded and haunted of her mother's past. Many years before, Hye-yang (thought to be unlucky) left her native village, then the new home she had made for herself. Tricked into a hell of abuse, murder and prostitution at a segregated American army camp, Hye-yang (now called Helen) escapes and is married by a white GI -- only to be dumped when her baby is born with dark skin. The thought of her mother's past haunts Helen as she stumbles across a corpse on the beach, falls in love for the first time, and starts to really get to know her mother. Reading \"Book of Dead Birds,\" you can almost smell the birds and salt of the Salton Sea. Brandeis has a special talent for putting her readers into the places she writes of, even if they've never been there. And she knows how to tug at the heartstrings without straining them. Brandeis's writing has an understated lyricism, a sort of poetry without self-consciousness. Her social commentary is all the stronger because it doesn't beat you over the head, and the tragedies all the more terrible because they aren't milked. Ava's sections are more introspective and far-reaching, while Helen's are starker. Sprinkled between chapters are bits of Helen's \"Book of Dead Birds,\" saddening and humorous at once. Ava is a startlingly vivid character, whose life is not so much sad as it is empty. It's fantastic to see her gradually coming into the happiness she deserves. Helen is quiet, repressed, keeping her past hidden and only letting her sorrow show for the birds. Supporting characters, like the unfortunate little girl Jeniece and the fiery prostitute Sun are equally well-done. As pretty and deceptively simple-looking as a bird, this book is a haunting, ultimately heartwarming look at mothers and daughters. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>Best known for his \"Discworld\" series, Terry Pratchett actually penned several books prior to starting that. One of those is \"Only You Can Save Mankind,\" the first book of a young adult trilogy, which shows some of his initial roughness but is still convincing and enjoyable. Johnny Maxwell is an extremely smart but otherwise ordinary English boy, who enjoys hanging out with his friends Wobbler, Yo-less, and Bigmac (their respective nicknames are all explained in the book) and exchanging pirated video games. One of these, \"Only You Can Save Mankind,\" focuses on defeating reptilian aliens called ScreeWees. But suddenly the ScreeWees surrender. Johnny is, unsurprisingly, quite taken aback: video game enemies are supposed to continue fighting, not surrender and ask him to stop firing. Then the game shows nothing but empty space. Johnny assumes that there is something odd about it, but nothing can prepare him for what it turns out to be: The ScreeWees are real aliens, who are attacked when someone uses the video game. Though very different from his Discworld series, \"Only You Can Save Mankind\" has the stamp of a Terry Pratchett book. From the quiet hero who sees it all, to supporting characters called \"Wobbler,\" it's all Pratchett. The conversations are Pratchett's usual slightly rambling, nuggets-of-wisdom dialogue. The narrative style is much rougher and starker than in this later books, without the polish to be found in his later books. However, he also adds in some swsssh and fplatfplatfplat sound effects whenever the video game is dealt with. The ScreeWees are interesting and original, although I hope Mr. Pratchett has since learned that amphibians do not have scales. The humor is very unique and original, such as when the Captain tells Johnny to order Jumboburgers for an entire spacefleet, or the long-running Sigourney Weaver joke. On the other hand, he also provides some intelligent questions that are left for the reader to ponder, and an enjoyably whimsical plot: \"What if video games were real acts of war?\" Johnny is an endearing hero in the mold of Pratchett's Discworld character Teppic, a young and slightly naive young boy with a quick brain and a very difficult situation. His supporters Kristy, Wobbler, Yo-less and Bigmac are all set apart by individual quirks like Wobbler's endearing lack of ethics, Yo-less's conscientous attitude, and Bigmac's appetite. The Captain doesn't appear much, but she is tough and easy to sympathize with. Though hard to find in the United States, the Johnny Maxwell trilogy is well worth the read, especially for Pratchett fans.</td></tr><tr><td>Travelling the fantasy trail that \"Lord of the Rings\" blazed, \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\" is one of the most hotly anticipated movies of 2005. It has battles, epic adventure, magic and a massive clash between good and evil, set against the lush backdrop of New Zealand. And it's adapted from a classic early fantasy. Yes, it sounds a bit like a cash in, now that \"Lord of the Rings\" is over. But Perry Moore's \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe: Official Illustrated Movie Companion\" reveals that it's anything but. In this rich colourful book goes behind the scenes, to show us how the movie came together and how it unfolded. Moore describes how the project got off the ground, scouting for locations and the pre-visualization that helped them create Narnia's otherworldly battles and beasts, especially the lion-god Aslan. Director Andrew Adamson seems to be almost frothing with enthusiasm during his own interview, and at various other times. Costume sketches, computer graphics, and careful details are included, such as the symbolic carving on the wardrobe doors, or the studies of how centaurs would move if they existed. There is even more stuff about how  WETA Workshops brought Narnia alive, with armor, monsters, prosthetics, and some very imaginative CGI animals. It's not all fun and games, though. Moore describes their problems as well. There was some difficulty casting Edmund, and Skandar Keynes almost didn't make it on. And there was also the question of including Father Christmas in Narnia, but not having a mall Santa. With the help of an Alan Lee picture, they gave the jolly old fellow a radical revamp. If the pictures are anything to do by, it's for the better. It also gives us a glimpse at the actors. Of particular interest are the four main ones, describing their personalities and the funny quirks they have, and the pranks William Moseley and Keynes played on one another. Anna Popplewell contributes a film diary, and Georgie Henley conducted surprisingly insightful interviews with cast and crew. As Brian Sibley did with the \"Lord of the Rings\" guides, Moore does a great job of giving readers a feel for what this movie is going to be like. And, perhaps even more importantly, the amount of enthusiasm and talent that is going into the movie's production. If this is any indication, all is going to be well. Moore keeps the tone of the book conversational and friendly, with plenty of funny stories to balance out the intricate descriptions of gritty acting and CGI effects. For example, Georgie Henley playing a dictionary game, and calling out a naughty word, or Anna Popplewell being afraid of mice. Not many making-of guides include that human factor, so it's refreshing to have that balanced out. There is also a wealth of movie photos here: Peter battling the Witch, the gifts, petrified Narnians, goblins, the Witch's ice castle, and the kindly old professor. There are also behind-the-scenes stuff, everything from \"centaurs\" in greenscreen leggings to a guy hauling Aslan's head across a field. Perry Moore does an excellent job with \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe: The Official Illustrated Movie Companion,\" giving an exciting glimpse through the wardrobe doors.</td></tr><tr><td>love the whole series!</td></tr><tr><td>Great book</td></tr><tr><td>Travis O'Hearn arrives in Pine Cove and he's not alone. With him is a demon, Catch, that answers to him for the past 90 years. Travis has been criss-crossing the country, tracking down a way to rid himself of the demon. Meanwhile, Gian Hen Gian, King of the Djinn, also shows up and enlists the aid of Augustus Brine to eliminate said demon. Throw in a mix of off-kilter characters and you get Christopher Moore's first book, \"Practical Demonkeeping\". Maybe I'm tainted by his later works or maybe he has just improved that much but this book was just ok for me. Better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fluke-Or-I-Know-Why-the-Winged-Whale-Sings-Today-Show-Book-Club-25/dp/006056668X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fluke: Or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings (Today Show Book Club #25)</a>&nbsp;but nowhere near as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lamb-The-Gospel-According-to-Biff-Christ-s-Childhood-Pal/dp/0380813815/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal</a>. Either way, it's a good introduction into Christopher Moore's writings, is a quick read, and you just may get a few laughs from it.</td></tr><tr><td>This book arrived in a timely fashion and it is an exciting read with lots of twists and turns. I bought it to read the original story upon which both the British and merican TV series was based. I ams og lad to know how the original was set up and how well it was written. Thank you for a great read!</td></tr><tr><td>this cook is epic, you don't like the main character but you admire him. His life is complex and not easy to put onto paper. it is hard at times to read but the end always gets me, it's so simple and so powerful. Truly this is a book that I can return to and reread often.</td></tr><tr><td>One of the disadvantages of reviewing something after 1,000+ other people have already posted their observations is that there's nothing left to say that hasn't already been said numerous times. So I'll keep my comments brief.  \"Freakonomics\" is not a book of great substance. In it, the authors explore a half-dozen topics, and offer some (perhaps) new insights into various matters. Some of what they say borders on the obvious (e.g. realtors don't really work for their clients' best interests; they work for their own best interests) while others fall into the \"who cares\" category (e.g. an overlong exploration of fixed matches in the world of sumo wrestling).  Still, the book is a interesting read, and contains just enough new ideas to provide fodder for cocktail party conversations. I give it a low 4 stars overall.</td></tr><tr><td>It's the same cast of characters--General Ferguson and Sean Dillon--teaming up again. I particularly enjoyed the beginning, in Hitler's bunker during the last days of WWII. I liked the character of Max Von Berger, an SS officer who was destined to be the keeper of Hitler's secret diary. This book is not Higgins at his best. But, is still better writing than one gets from most authors.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved it. It draws you in out of no where and its impossible to put it down once you've hit that point.</td></tr><tr><td>Though the plot was intriguing this work was more wordy than Jane Austen 's other novels. More modern minds would remove fully one third of the verbiage. One could make an argument that Miss Austen wrote this as a morality play. One could also argue that in her mind marriage needed to be a mating of minds, body and principles. Any marriage made with less than those requirements is a sham. That pretty much sums up her opinion of marriage for personal gain.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this book, couldn't stop reading it. It gives such an insight how one feels about themself if they are \"not perfect\" and how they deal with society and their judgements.</td></tr><tr><td>Anne Rivers Siddons at her best. Very interesting characters and plot. Love author's use of language. Loved every bit of this book.</td></tr><tr><td>The pictures and the idea of this book are great, but it totally falls short in the writing.  Mr. Crystal needs to head back to high school for a course in rhyme scheme and rhythm.  A lot of the lines are forced and awkward to read - mediocre, at best.  Case in point: \"I have the feeling that you understand everything I say, like granpa boo boo lee doo, la la la la la lay.\" Uhm, yeah.  Lines like that make me wonder if Mr. Crystal just scribbled out some half thought-out lines just to see if his book would sell based on his name alone. The only redeeming quality that this book has is the beautiful collection of illustrations by Guy Porfirio.  I make up my own words and just show the pictures to my little one.</td></tr><tr><td>Great love story and behind the scenes of what mercenaries do.  Hard to put down.  We can make up the ending ourselves.</td></tr><tr><td>One of the best kids books, entertains adults and the kid.  After renting this for many weeks with renewals from the library I had to buy it. Great writing as if a 10 year old was really talking in a day in the life documentary \" the office\" style superhero movie. I could see this writer liking \"what we do in the shadows\" and/or \"the office\".</td></tr><tr><td>The audio book read by  Virginia Leashman is superb!</td></tr><tr><td>Though, for some reason, Belong to Me is treated as a standalone, it's really not. I'm not sure why the publisher decided not to market them as a series, since they are directly linked. Oh well. I read the first book, Love Walked In, a few years ago, and I was really impressed. Ever since, I've recommended it to people, but, with my memory and the way my taste in books can change and grow over time, I wondered if it was really as good as I remember it being. Well, if Belong to Me is any sort of reliable indicator, then yes. I highly recommend reading Love Walked In first, then moving to Belong to Me. All the same characters from Love Walked In are back. On the surface, de los Santos' books look like chick lit, like girly, light, fluff books, at least that's what I get from the covers and the titles. While her books do, admittedly, have way more female appeal, I would in no way mark them as 'chick lit,' though the boundaries between 'chick lit' and 'women's fiction' and 'literary fiction' are hazy to me at best. De los Santos' novels are packed full of emotion and wit and hope, and are incredibly beautifully written. There are authors whose prose I just glory in, immersing myself in their words as though they were the perfect temperature pool, and de los Santos belongs on that list. Belong to Me may be a bit of a cheesy title, but it speaks directly to the main thrust of the novel: belonging. Each of the main characters struggle with finding a place to belong, and, perhaps even more, with finding a place where they belong that doesn't fit their initial expectations. These themes move me so much, because, really, aren't we all looking for that place where we belong, that person that makes us feel at home wherever we are? This is one of those books that makes me want to believe so hard that happy endings are possible, not so much because 'true love' is real, but because a more basic, more enduring, more real love is out there and that people will work to preserve it. De los Santos writes from multiple perspectives, a common, though still daring, writerly move. Not only that, but she writes with one first person perspective and the others in third person limited. In both books, the reader lives in Cornelia's head, follows her around in first person, feels directly with her. In Love Walked In, the other perspective is that of Clare, a girl whose connection to Cornelia is not immediately apparent. In Belong to Me, we have Cornelia's and two more: Piper, the queen bee of Cornelia and Teo's new suburban neighborhood, and Dev, a brilliant young teen. Cornelia and Teo have just moved into a house in the suburbs for his new job. She's a city girl, and doesn't like the sniping of the local women; she feels lost without friends, without the buzzing of the city. I may be biased by the storytelling methods, but Cornelia is my favorite character. In fact, for the first hundred pages or so, my mind wandered a bit when the story went to the other perspectives, because I just didn't care as much about the others. A wholly forthright person, she protects people, loves poetry and sometimes lets her temper get the better of her. Cornelia has a unique way of phrasing thing and a brutal honesty about the selfishness of her emotions that makes me relate to her so much. I hated Piper so much at first. You're supposed to, of course, but that doesn't make her any less awful. She's one of those people: perky, bitchy, obsessed with being the best, etc. As I read her perspective, I just kept fantasizing about stabbing her with a nail file. Then, though, she changed, rather suddenly, but not unbelievably. Her very best friend, possibly her only true friend, is dying of cancer. She throws herself into caring for Elizabeth, and, for the first time in her life almost, gives no thought to her image. Her struggle is to discover that she doesn't belong where she thought she did, as the queen of society, but as a person with wants and desires, even if they don't make her popular. It's amazing to me that de los Santos made me care for her character. One of my very favorite over-used characters is the genius child. Yeah, I know there are far more genius children in fiction than in real life, but I just don't care. If I have to read about children, they damn well ought to be clever. Dev fits that perfectly. He has such a thirst for knowledge, about poetry, string theory, friendship, and his father, who he doesn't know. His mother left his father because she knew he couldn't take care of the baby, but Dev resents the man for not coming to find him, while also hating himself for still clinging to that fantasy. So, yes, the characters are marvelous. You know what's even better? Their relationships with one another. It's one thing to have great characters, and another thing entirely to make their friendships and romances ring authentic and awkward and painful and true, but de los Santos hits those notes just right. I'm not a big crier, but my eyes did get a bit teary, both from sadness and happiness, more than once. Friendship isn't often enough of a focus, but each of these characters have friends who feel real, and who will have their backs. The one last thing I feel that I must say about this novel before I wrap the review: de los Santos surprised me. Finding a book that can really sweep a rug out from under your feet is a rare thing, at least for me. She has this way of weaving story lines together in such a way that I think I know where things are going, but then BAM! they go somewhere else. I may have yelled at the book a bit in frustration when I got to the twist, because I didn't want the characters to be unhappy at all. Obviously, I just love this book. I'm honestly not entirely certain who to recommend this book to, because I'm having trouble sticking it in a box. Basically, if you enjoy beautiful writing, pop culture references, and women's issues, then you should really read Marisa de los Santos.</td></tr><tr><td>an amazing thinker.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book</td></tr><tr><td>Refreshing, well written and entertaining :-)</td></tr><tr><td>as always.....</td></tr><tr><td>I was astonished to hear a couple of people in a library book group describe it as a \"beach read,\" but then they were at least 10 years older than me (I'm 47).  To me the 2 main characters are both going through a midlife crisis of examining what happened to the \"Big Picture\" ideas and ideals of their younger days, and figuring out what they believe now, and how they got from those youthful grand-philosophy ideals to a state of just getting through each day/week/month doing what they have to to pay the bills.  All things that hit home for me now.  Maybe when you get many years past midlife crisis reading about it is a \"fluffy beach read\" or maybe these ladies never had a self-examining midlife crisis.  One had skipped over the letters that the former monk writes back to a friend still in the monastery, which are the author's technique for telling us what's going on inside his (the monk's) head; others read them but found them annoying.  Maybe they're just incapable of reading such introspective stuff.  I had to re-read it to decide which one of us was nuts; I'm still in the middle of the 2nd read-through, but I'm still enjoying it. In any case, I thought the deeper, introspective stuff was well-balanced with the humor.  The only thing that might have strained credibility a bit was that the monk's re-entry to a sexual life wasn't more awkward after being celibate for 20 years.</td></tr><tr><td>It was interesting reading this classic for the first time.  However I found it fairly predictable.  I can see how many other novels are based on a facsimile of this story.  It was definitely a commentary on the customs regarding women at that time.</td></tr><tr><td>it's an awesome read!!! deep, meaningful, down to earth yet insightful & healing</td></tr><tr><td>This book is kind of dull. If you are looking for a description of a distopian society then sure, it's fine. But the story lacks any real interesting plot.</td></tr><tr><td>Like reading a plotless blog.  I tried to read every page but kept losing interest. I would not reccmend it</td></tr><tr><td>A relaxing book to read when you are not in a hurry.</td></tr><tr><td>I started reading this booking over Christmas but have yet to finish it. It's pretty good kinda of slow but i enjoy Dorothea Benton Frank so I want to keep with it. I wish it were funnier.</td></tr><tr><td>Unlike most books written about Ruby Ridge and Waco, this book is well written and straightforward, free of the extremist polemics that fill other accounts. It also makes a good, suspenseful read.</td></tr><tr><td>The author presents us with a history of the smartest scientists of thwe world and science breakthru's that could lead back to reasons how the world started. This book is a technical description of how the world started. There is an interesting discussion of the fact that some people believe that Gos started the world and allowed the big bang to happen and we still have to show how that God sanctioned trigger occurred.</td></tr><tr><td>This book has an interesting twist to it. The author was photographed with the Boston Strangler when he was a year old. Starting there, Mr Junger sucessfully presents a most detailed account of a black man who was put away for the killing of a woman, whose murder most resembled the way Al Desalvo, the Boston Strangler, killed many other women. The detail here is incredible and the doubts raised of Ray Smith(the black man accused) and the doubts raised about DeSalvo as well as worthwhile.</td></tr><tr><td>Great Christmas stories. For kids but im a kid at heart and i like it. It takes you back to your childhood.</td></tr><tr><td>After reading most of Crichton's books, it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books. With such books as 'Jurassic Park', 'The Andromeda Strain', and 'Disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run. This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book. The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. It is hard to believe some of the books imagery. This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology. If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read, then this book is good. However, if you're looking for Crichton's next great novel, I didn't think this book stood up with the rest.</td></tr><tr><td>A great storyline that was highly entertaining. I enjoyed every minute of it, especially the political bantering. It was thoughtful and funny, and I liked the way it handled some of the stereotypes and hurtful prejudices we all have, and unfortunately display. The author brought all the characters to life and I wish I could have seen the play.</td></tr><tr><td>Book is much better than the movie: more developed characters, more interesting subplots. Yet both have captured that magical pink world  of wealth and privilege that many of us secretly long for.</td></tr><tr><td>I had previously read these authors' take on the middle ages in a Rural setting; LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE.  My major complaint with that book was that it was very dry and specific to an English Countryside in a very specific timeframe. LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CITY, although referring specifically to urban life in 1200's France, is much more what I was looking for as a general description of social structure in the middle ages.  Moreover, it is much more enjoyable to read. Gies (Husband and Wife) describe traditional roles in a city, such as the Baker, Butcher, Cooper, Smithy, etc.  In contrast to the dire and overcast life of a farmer in a village, this book feels lively and vital.  You can almost smell the conflagration of scullery stoves, livestock, and less than hygenic sewage systems as you read. The various political strata are also explained in detail.  The clergy, the merchant class, the noble houses, and the trade guilds all get their fair share of the spotlight (or should I say lamplight?).  What also makes this account so lively as a social setting is the various nationalities influencing central europe at the time.  We have brief descriptions given of the early Roman occupations and the infrastructure they left, the Normans influences, the Saracens and their vast trade empire, and many other political forces who all mingled in this area in the past and in the present (of the book). I could not have asked for a better overview of a functioning medieval city as a reference for understanding it's use in most fantasy books, as well as anyone interested in the slow advancement of Western Civilization through the post-roman era.  Once you have read this book you will be able to appreciate historical fiction and fantasy so much more. I would urge anyone who wants to either expand their knowledge of the middle ages, better appreciate books set in that time (or by extention nearly all fantasy works), or is attempting to write about a subject that would relate to this time to read this book and keep it on their shelf for reference.</td></tr><tr><td>My granddaughter was about to start this book so I told her I would read it at the same time.  My, I was surprised by the early violence in the story. However, as the story proceeded I found it full of heart warming moments, mystery, and suspense. Story line ... think Jungle Book Mowgli except the boy cub is being taken care of by the spirits, souls, and long past residents of a cemetery. The boy, Bod, as in Jungle Book . Is taught all the skills of his environment.  After many adventures in and out of the cemetery ,Bod, is ready to go out and live life in the world.  I do have to admit that I  kept the book open and ready to be read for two days.  I was drawn in and enjoyed the ride.</td></tr><tr><td>I tried, really I did.  I've read every Johanna Lindsey at least twice if not more, even this one...I think I've given it three chances.  Yes, it does seem to grow on me after such a time BUT I still find it incredibly absurd.  Granted, most of Lindseys are...and I love so many...but this one really does take the cake for being quite unbelievable.  I just found the whole concept of her tying him up to 'have her way with him' and him gaining revenge in the same manner ridiculous.  Not Johanna's best.</td></tr><tr><td>I think this was my last try at a Sherilyn Kenyon/Kinsley McGregor novel. At first I really enjoyed the Dark Hunter series but she's gone the way of Christine Feehan where every character is a regurgitation of the others who came before. I barely managed to finish this one. She totally trivializes the antagonists in her books. It may have been more interesting of Morgan had more depth and wasn't just one-demensional and stupid.</td></tr><tr><td>its for school. interesting approach from C.S. Lewis.</td></tr><tr><td>good reading</td></tr><tr><td>I discovered this book while searching at Amazon for new books.  I never knew that Sidney had ever written a book so this was a pleasant surprise for me.  I enjoyed the story.  I learned a lot about the author that I did not know.</td></tr><tr><td>Do you like romance novels?  Do you go for contrived plot,labored dialogue, unsuccessful attempts at humor, overstating of the obvious, over-the-top sentimentality, zero intellectual content or context?  Do you admire factual inaccuracy and contradictory and incompatible  plot lines? If your answer is yes to the above, re-rate the book with 5 stars and put it on your reading list. Otherwise, don't make the mistake I made by picking up this book.</td></tr><tr><td>I lived through many of the events Jane Leavy describes. I grew up in Southern California, and it is beyond uncanny how accurately she captures the spirit of the times. I attended a Koufax no-hitter, but not the one described in the book. Everything rang true. I heard Vin Scully's voice. I smelled the cigar smoke at Dodger stadium. I felt Koufax's presence. But that doesn't even begin to tell the whole story. The real accomplishment is that this brilliant, gifted writer wrote a book about sports that -- while full of sports  -- is not really a sports biography, at least not in the sense of the works typical of this genre. Leavy's book is a meditation on memory, heroism, and celebrity. How and why we elevate certain people to heroic stature? What that does for us. What that does to the hero. And most of all it is a character study of an American original, an ultimately not all that mysterious guy who defied the standard orthodoxy on how to exploit a persona for financial gain. And she places Koufax smack dab in the middle of the era in which he pitched so brilliantly. Sports biographies at their best are often triumphal, confessional, or bogged down in trivia. This is social history and philosophy in brilliantly crafted prose. OK, guys, I also cried. This wonderful book really transported me back to the night when, with my Mom and Dad and sister, we sat transfixed through Koufax's no-hitter against the Mets. These weren't cheap tears, but the product of emotion that only could be engendered by the kind of meditation on life and memory that Jane Leavy produced. I can only dream of what would happen if her skills as a historian, biographer, and philosopher were set loose on any number of personalities in and out of sports, especially somewhat secretive people who have genreally defied good description. In fact, I will wait patiently and eagerly for anyone she wants to tackle in her next book. Jane, why not try someone out of the sports world? My last point (I promise): There ARE other wonderful sports writers. And, while I would rather not name to whom I am referring, even the best of them often fall victim to injecting themselves into the story. God bless 'em, but they just aren't as interesting to us as they think they are. Jane Leavy's masterpiece is about America, about Koufax, and about memory. It is not about Jane Leavy, although -- with her skills -- even an autobiography would almost certainly be riveting. Think I liked it?</td></tr><tr><td>I chose this book simply because I'd never read it. I ended up loving it. In fact, I ended up doing a bit of research into author and story just to satisfy my reading experience. Very well written with continual fascination.</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps I enjoyed this novel so much because it was my first introduction to Susan Sto Helit, who has become my favorite Discworld character (among many!). However, I must say that it was also my first experience with Igor, and he's a character not to be missed! If you've enjoyed \"Mort,\" \"Soul Music\" and \"Hogfather,\" you must read this book to see what Susan's been up to lately. If you've never read any of the Discworld novels, this is a fine place to start!</td></tr><tr><td>I have read all of Jane Austen's novels in the order in which they were published.  Emma is my favorite.  I have always wondered why some of her other work is so popular and Emma seems relatively unknown.  In reading some of the other reviews it appears that the romantic aspect of the other novels is what makes them so attractive.  But I find the humor in this novel to be hilarious, much more so than her more popular novels.  And both Emma and her father are two of my favorite characters in all of literature.  This is the one Jane Austen novel that most reminds me of my personal favorite author, George Eliot.</td></tr><tr><td>I love the majority of Lynsay Sands books but this one isn't one of those. There were so many little things wrong with this book. First off, the prologue...who was Tanya and what happened to her? I'm guessing she was a victim of the \"rogue\" vampire but I'm still not sure. Were the bites on Sam's neck the result of those flies or was she too bitten by the rogue? Cathy Latimer - was there an actual reason for her to even be in the book or is she going to be a future story? And finally, let's face it...it's hard to romanticize a character who is called Mortimer! At the back of the book Lynsay mentions that we'll be seeing more of Sam and Mortimer, I'm guessing we'll see her sisters hook up with other immortals and Sam will eventually be turned. Let's just hope their stories are more complete than Sam's.</td></tr><tr><td>My son liked it . Hard to find books for reluctant readers</td></tr><tr><td>The story was good. Led you around from person to person, but this only included Miss Marple. The vicar was the main character and I liked him. I am wondering about the next book...</td></tr><tr><td>I don't do written.  My stars should be enough</td></tr><tr><td>Do you know how a certain book or movie will completely transport you to another time and place?  That is the effect the Betsy-Tacy and Tib series of books had on me.  I read the entire series about 14 years ago and even now, from time to time, I'll remember them and smile because of all the joy they brought into my life.  They lived at the turn of the 20th century and grew up with the invention of the automobile and the first World War.  Maud-Hart Lovelace writes of a time of innocence and wonder and I personally feel like Betsy and Tacy and Tib are life long friends that will always exist in my heart and I'll always hold dear the memories of their young lives.  There are not many books that grab hold of you like this cherished series does but when they do, you will forever be caught up in the spell of three little girls growing up in a kinder and gentler era and their many adventures and loves and losses.  I highly recommend these books to ANYONE if you want to understand a bygone era, when our grandparents were growing up, and see the world through their eyes.  I loved the books when they were small and when Betsy went to Europe for a year and of all her escapades in Italy and Germany.  I'll never forget the many Friday nights the gang would get together and eat onion sandwiches Betsy's father would make, and how everyone would sing around the piano. The genuine love and warmth the friends and family felt for one another was uplifting and heartwarming and beautiful to read about.  And Betsy's boyfriend Joe was also a loyal friend and played a prominent role in the series.  If I could step into any world from the past, I would choose their world.  You can't ask  more from a book. Please do yourself a huge favor, and order these books.  I plan on buying the series as well and begin reading them to my three year old daughter in a few years.</td></tr><tr><td>This my son's absolute favorite bedtime book right not. He's 3. I actually have my mother's copy of this book of this book. Three generations have loved this book and it's still in great condition! The boardbook was just o-kay, but when I started reading the full hard cover version to him, he really loved it. I fell into the trap that many parents did and bought a ton of the Dr. Suess series books in boardbook form before my son was born, only to realize that the stories are abridged and not as good as the original. The board books were a great introduction for him as an infant, short reads and sturdy, easy to clean. But a lot of the charm of Dr. Suess books is lost in the boardbook version. Many authors offer the whole book in boardbook form, so it took me awhile to realize why the Dr. Suess ones weren't as appealing to me or my son. So with the Dr. Suess books I had to buy all the books again in hardcover so he would have the whole story as a toddler. If I had known this I would have just purchased a few board books, and started collecting the hardcover versions much sooner!</td></tr><tr><td>Christopher doesn't quite have all that his dad did. But this is still a good read for Tolkien lovers.</td></tr><tr><td>Find something else to read.  This is not believable.  I did want to get to the end of the story but I became impatient with the middle.</td></tr><tr><td>I can't say much because most of it is already said about this book, but what I will say is that even though this book took me 6 days to read, it was the best I have ever read. Don't let a story about bunnies deceive you because this book was hardly childish and a great read. Although rabbits talking is kind of silly it wasn't silly at all.</td></tr><tr><td>Creative unusual and thought provoking. Haldeman tells a tale alternate human aging.</td></tr><tr><td>I mean come on. If you haven't read this book yet you're missing out on a classic. My son absolutly loved it and laughed his way through the pages. There's even a movie based on this classic. Great read.</td></tr><tr><td>If you have addictions of any kind, you should read this book. At the core of what keeps us addicted is often shame and the rejection of the power of grace. We may be shamed by ourselves, our family, our church or our society. We miss the magnitude and scope of God's grace. Satan thrives on that and convinces us how despicable we are, driving us further into our addictions (how can a miserable person like me deserve to be close to God). A vicious cycle, which was close to being broken, continues anew. This book helps us understand that, which gets us on the path to recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Robin Hobb is just so good. Love this trilogy.</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to love this book but there were so many typos and misspellings, the editor should be embarrassed.</td></tr><tr><td>IT SHOWS TO ME HOW MANY GREAT PEOPLE COME FROM THE LOVE & CARING OF THEIR  PARENTS RESULTS IN THE BRINGS OUT THE GREATNESS IN THEM  I LOVE THIS MAN FOR HIS INTEGRITY & LOVE OF HIS GOD</td></tr><tr><td>Great combination of combining history with fiction. Bernard puts the reader in the action and you feel you are there watching events unfold. Good quick reading.</td></tr><tr><td>NOTE and EDIT: My initial review focused on how this book might be used to educate and enlighten the American populace and help head-off a number of troubling developments in politics, education and religion. But the author takes a much larger view than that, helping me understand for the first time ever the differences and relationships between Liberalism, Conservatism and Progressivism in American politics first and then expanding the view to encompass the entire history of worldwide political systems, to include Communism, Fascism, and modern-day Islamism, all of which are anti-liberal, anti-scientific and anti-democratic Totalitarian systems. Both conservatism and progressivism are equidistant from Liberalism and Totalitarianism and so can be pulled either way; unfortunately, world history records that several anti-Enlightenment philosophies have successfully produced strong drives toward Totalitarianism rather than Liberalism, actual events that have had dire consequences for the world. Islamism is nothing if not Totalitarian, and currently takes on much of the worst of Marxist and Fascist ideology. And although Mr. Ferris didn't mention it, the same trends can be observed in today's growing Christian Dominionist movements in both the American public and the military, as it sucks in large numbers of conservatives. The good news is that liberal democracy has weathered every storm; the bad news is that forces of intolerance, authoritarian bigotry and enforced ignorance are on the march in America and I fear our foundations of liberty are in store for yet another costly test. Perhaps there is still time for an enlightened citizenry to stand up and say, \"No!\" This book should become the most widely-read book of the century, both here in America and abroad. This is a Pulitzer-level work, written in a very understandable style that should be accessible to just about everyone. ***** Original review follows... The most insidious things happening in American politics today are those seemingly based on complete ignorance (genuine or willful) of the Enlightenment principles upon which our form of government was established. We have politicians lining up for the highest offices in the nation while making public pronouncements that amount to a self-serving, do-it-yourself and blatantly bogus history of the American Experiment. There are likewise no shortages of current political philosophies based on the myth of the \"noble savage\", as outlined in the imaginations of Rousseau and others. Far from trying to \"return our nation to its Christian roots\", the nation as a whole could benefit greatly by making a sincere effort to remember (or learn for the first time) the true story of the foundations of American democracy. Such a thing is possible and this book is a great place to begin. Want the Truth? A fact seemingly forgotten by theocratic and other zealots actively engaged in rewriting American history for their own gain or the assumed gain of their misguided ideologies or religions is the one problem they cannot overcome: the Founders of the United States were prolific writers who recorded their thoughts for posterity and whose words are enshrined in America's national documents. The true history cannot be erased! Neither can the words of the writers who were very adept at explaining what their words meant. The Science of Liberty is a roadmap for those who want to dig deeper. Untruths will ultimately fail their authors and promoters. The same is inevitable for lies about American history; home-schoolers may succeed for awhile, the Texas Schoolbook Commission may succeed for awhile, the current leadership of the Republican Party may succeed for awhile in suppressing the truth, but from whom? They keep it from their own children, ultimately; children who will grow up being less knowledgeable of their own nation's history than the average schoolchild in the typical European public school system. The only places you won't find true American history being taught are in totalitarian nations fearful of the truth and, of course, in places like Texas. And yet, such people as these have the audacity to claim that they are the best guardians of America? All history teaches us that ignorance has never been an effective defense against anything. It only allows a few at the top to profit for awhile from the ignorance of their followers. The liberty of science is the free, unfettered investigation of the natural world. The Science of Liberty is about the efforts of free human beings, unfettered by kings or gods, to devise a system of self-governance based on hard-won experience and knowledge of the real world and human nature, a secular American Experiment, imperfect but correctable, in the same manner as true scientific endeavor. The result has been one of the freest, one of the most progressive and one of the richest and most successful nations to have ever existed on the planet, and a template for similar democracies. The system established was not perfect and immutable, but rather a process; an unending process dedicated to being adaptable to an ever-changing future, a process that doesn't eliminate the possibility of mistakes, but one that is self-correcting, like science. America is an evolving process with no end in sight save one: the best form of human governance possible in every age. Let this book be your guide, your inspiration for embracing the true and indelible story of the birth and development of the United States. There is no finer place to start. Better yet, buy a copy and send it to your favorite Senator, Representative, Governor or anyone else who is actively losing his way.</td></tr><tr><td>It dragged, entertaining but pretty slow.</td></tr><tr><td>While I did enjoy reading this book, I read it along with a religious expert, someone who teaches religion and studies history (but has an open mind) so I could get that extra insight. I felt I'd be less than fair in my review if I added only my perspective. However, I did discover that even without the extra input, I felt that the book was lacking. I actually knew enough to realize that the writer's perspective and background in this area was not strong enough to cover all the facets of the subject matter. Was the book interesting? Yes, I found it interesting. However, I think it leaves much to be desired when it comes to combining religious thought, perspective and even history with the acts of forgery described in this book. The character studies at the beginning of the book are strong and I found them  compelling. But right from the start, the religious expert was complaining about huge inaccuracies and information left out - noting that it was clear that the author had no background or expertise in religious studies. Sadly, I have to agree. This book came across almost as an essay or travelogue in book form. I am not a snob or purist about these things. It is NOT always an issue when a person who is not an \"expert\" writes a book. In fact, a different perspective can even be refreshing.. But in this case I do think the lack of expertise raised some serious issues and resulted in a flawed book. I really wanted the book to focus on the actual artifacts but instead the author wrote many pages of background info about the people in the book, the thieves, forgers and the people who believed them...and while that was engaging, it wasn't what I'd consider the main point of a book like this....unless one wanted only to read character studies. In that case, the book might not disappoint. I wanted to know more about the James Ossuary as well as actual historical information. Just about every other page, my friend was stopping me and saying things like \"that is a major inaccuracy\" or \"that simply is not true.\" That really bothered me. If a book is going to be written as nonfiction and covers historical information, then I think that information ought to be correct. I took notes and researched the inaccuracies noted by my friend and they did raise serious questions about the author's research and the information in the book. If you read this, you can come to your own conclusions.</td></tr><tr><td>Daniel Silva's latest novel is well-written, continues the story line from prior novels, and concludes with an ending the make me wonder above the future of his lead character, Gabriel Allon, and the development of Christopher Keller for future novels.</td></tr><tr><td>Sidney Sheldon is among my all-time favorite authors. Finding one of his books in a Kindle edition is almost like finding gold. This book was riveting from start to finish!</td></tr><tr><td>This novel provides good, light entertainment, posing no intellectual challenges. But it is entertaing and suspenseful.</td></tr><tr><td>Better than Lord of the Rings, less happy than Harry Potter. I highly recommend it even though it's long its a great series and it doesn't get dull.</td></tr><tr><td>The style of this book was slightly different from the previous three. Cliff hangers were thrown at you in a much more in-your-face approach rather than the subtleties from the earlier books. I understand that the book was too long and needed to be continued, but there was no wrap up other than G.R.R.M.'s apologetic (sorry but not sorry) end. Not my favorite of the series, but still a continuation of an incredible epic tale.</td></tr><tr><td>made me cry.  EJ</td></tr><tr><td>NEXT is full of extreme subplots highlighting how naive we are on what is beginning to happen in the area of gene research and the social implications of that pursuit. The stories within the book do show Crichton's bias, can't fault him for taking a firm stand on an issue. NEXT simply reflects the state of society.  The writing style reminds me of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code that does keep you turning pages. I must admit this is the first Crichton book I have read, though I have seen many of his movie adaptations. It could have \"flowed\" better had a more cohesive storyline. It's ironic this week in NEWSWEEK there is a major article on test kits you can buy and use at home.(1/8/07) That article raises even more disturbing social and economic issues as well. Timely book? Absolutely.  Are there better written books? Yes. But it does raise one's awareness of issues that can get out of hand fast if we, yes you and I, do not arm ourselves with good information, both pro and con, with the issue gene research. You going to leave it to your congress person? Can you say, \"Polly wants a cracker?\"</td></tr><tr><td>I couldn't wait to read Rachel's Holiday after devouring \"Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married,\" and I was not disappointed.  From the very start, Ms. Keyes grabs our attention and maybe a little sympathy for the main character, Rachel.  Rachel is in a rehabilitation program after a suicide attempt - however, Rachel is also in denial that she attempted suicide - let alone that she has a drug problem. Through flashbacks and her therepy, we find a lot about Rachel that is as bittersweet as it is shocking and depressing.  It is an excellent read and the supporting characters from Rachel's sisters to roommates are all familliar to us. I loved this book until the ending.  While I am glad it ended on a happy note - I think it is a little unbelievable - but other than that - a very good read.</td></tr><tr><td>I had read ATOTC many years ago on my way to Paris, France. Thrilled to discover it still has the intensity of plot as that first read.</td></tr><tr><td>Love this classic poem. Wonderful illustrations throughout the whole book. The illustrations were very excellent on the Kindle Fire HD.</td></tr><tr><td>This was a great way to finish up an exciting series. While I would have liked to see some neglected story lines tied up, most were.</td></tr><tr><td>I Found this book to be slow at the beginning, but once it got going I was not able to put it down.</td></tr><tr><td>Keller is a hit man, someone willing to kill just about anyone if the price is right.  He understands that his long term survival depends on never being spotted at the scene of one of his hits and, if the circumstances require it, he is willing to kill any witnesses who come so close that they might later be able to identify him.  Man or woman, it really doesn't matter much to John Keller.  One can only hope that he at least draws the line at the children of his targets. And, with the help of Dot, the woman who functions as his manager, Keller has done quite well over the last few years.  He has a couple of million dollars stashed in an offshore bank account, a valuable stamp collection that he's nurtured for years, and intentions to retire after one last hit.  As for Dot, let's just say that she's perfectly suited for her job, seeing nothing wrong with killing for profit or for her own personal survival. But funny things happen on Keller's last job and, even though he senses that something is a little off about the job and the people who hired him, before he knows it he has been identified as the assassin of Iowa's governor and he, along with millions of others, is staring at his face on CNN.  As Keller sees it, his only chance is to make his way back to his New York City apartment where he hopes to regroup long enough to figure out a survival plan for himself and Dot. Getting from Des Moines to New York City with only a few dollars in cash, a stolen credit card or two, and a packet of expensive stamps in one pocket is not easy, as Keller is quick to learn.  But the hit man has acquired a few skills over the course of his career that give him a fighting chance of making it there in one piece and, since he could come up with no better plan, he heads in that direction. In \"Hit and Run,\" Lawrence Block has pulled off the near impossible task of making a rather despicable pair of killers like John Keller and his partner into sympathetic, even likable, characters.  It is hard not to root for them as they struggle to survive long enough to identify those who set them up to take the fall in a major political assassination and, when they decide to get even, they become the good guys in this dark comedy thriller. Lawrence Block makes all of this look a lot easier than it is.  He has written fifty-something books now and, although I've read quite a few of them, I've never been disappointed by one.  This one is book four of the \"Keller series\" but, strangely enough, it is the first novel of the series and easily can be enjoyed as a standalone novel by those unfamiliar with the Keller short story collections. Block has done it again; this one is fun</td></tr><tr><td>This book is very funny.  Satisfies my Buffy withdrawals, LOL.  Maybe Joss Whedon will pick this up for another TV pilot.  This would be fun to read on the beach in Jamaica, but works just as well in the long line at the post office. A really fun read.</td></tr><tr><td>This book tells Tracy Chevalier's made up story of a very real set of tapestries featuring several ladies and a unicorn that now sit at the Musee National du Moyen-Age Thermes de Cluny in Paris. The novel is set in Paris during the Middle Ages, takes us through the creation of the tapestries and the lives they effect, beginning with Nicolas des Innocents, who is anything but, and the women in his life. The story is woven as the tapestries and the lives of the characters. The tale is skillfully and artfully told. The writing is beautiful as the millefiore described in the art. The historical details are fascinating as is the journey through making the tapestries. This book is hard to put down. I loved this one almost as much as Girl with the Pearl Earring, and that is saying a lot because it is one of my all time favorite books. My book club also loved it.</td></tr><tr><td>Missing the stuffed animal and book had a cup ring.</td></tr><tr><td>It's been a while since I read thes book,it is not very memorable to me. I have read better crime books.</td></tr><tr><td>This really illustrates the need for national service. Not necessarily military but perhaps forest service or similar. Almost all of the thirty boys in my high school class served in the 1960s. Almost all are successful & satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>I was absolutely thrilled to receive a review copy of the newest book by one of my favorite authors. I probably squealed with glee! I have been a fan of Tim Powers' ever since I picked up a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dinner-at-Deviant-s-Palace/dp/1892284847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dinner at Deviant's Palace</a>&nbsp;about 6 years ago at my local library. I have liked just about everything Tim Powers has ever written, which puts him ahead of Neil Gaiman, and closely tied with Jerry Pournelle. So far, the only work of Tim Powers that I haven't liked much was&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Stress-of-Her-Regard/dp/1892391791/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Stress of Her Regard</a>, the kind of prequel to Hide Me Among the Graves. In interviews, Powers has said he didn't set out to create a sequel, he was simply fascinated by some strange events in the lives of the Rosettis, and when he did his usual digging into the subject, he found a surprising degree of overlap between the Rosettis and Lord Byron, John Keats, and other people who were the subject of the earlier book. Thus, it was only natural to write a book that continues the same secret history of the Nephilim. It wasn't until I read Hide Me Among the Graves that I fully appreciated why I didn't like The Stress of Her Regard. Byron and Keats and the other characters spend nearly the entire book in thrall to the Nephilim. This fits, because the Nephilim are vastly more powerful than humans, and their patronage bestows enviable powers, yet I could never really wrap my mind around the unwillingness, or inability, of the poets to fully repudiate their vampiric masters. Intellectually, I can understand their plight, but emotionally I simply cannot connect with these men. However, this made for a great setup in Hide Me Among the Graves, because the conflict between fighting the monsters, and literally embracing them was played out between, and in, each of the protagonists. This gave me something to cheer for, and something to hope against. For all that, I'm still not a vampire fan, or much of a fan of vampire stories. I like vanquishing vampires, but that exhausts my interest in the topic. Thus I enjoyed the book, but I won't be returning to it like I return to&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Last-Call/dp/B000GBFQR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Last Call</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>If you like a good mystery without all the gore, this is a good one. I stayed up until 5 a.m. without even realizing it, the morning after I downloaded this book because I just kept turning the pages instead of looking at the clock. First I thought it was this character, then that one. Short chapters make it just fly by. Good characters and good puzzle. I highly recommend, but then I've been a fan of Mary Jane Clark since her very first book.</td></tr><tr><td>I highly recommend this for every member of humanity, if only for the quality of writing and the thought processes that have gone into its words. In particular, I recommend the essays \"Membership\", \"On Forgiveness\", and \"Transposition\" in addition to the title work. This kind of reading is never time wasted.</td></tr><tr><td>Wicked is a phenomenal read.  I picked it up one Monday, and had it finished by Tuesday night.  This is the riveting story of the Wicked Witch of the West, trailing her through her formative years in random locales of Oz, then taking her through college and into the political unrest that plagued Oz after the arrival of \"The Wizard.\" I fell in love with the character of the Wicked Witch, who really isn't wicked at all, but was dissapointed, majorly so, in the ending.  For those who have not read it, I will not spoil it, but I did feel that the ending doesn't do justice to the style of the book, to the plotline, and most depressingly, it does not do justice to the character of the Witch.  I believe that even the author may have felt slightly anxious that he had done the wrong thing, as his pace quickens and he throws in strange pieces of comedy to punctuate his final scene. Rarely have I felt so strongly that I should rewrite the ending and slip my own pages in for the author's.  Elphaba deserved more than she was given. But still, this is a book I won't forget.</td></tr><tr><td>I was going to buy this book, but after reading the reviews I have lost interest.  God people are you really readers?  No one wants to know what's in the book before they buy it.  You guys review the book by telling most of the story.</td></tr><tr><td>Very enjoyable read Look forward to leaving reading his other books. Would recommend to friends especially Those who enjoy sailing</td></tr><tr><td>I've read MANY survival books, and this is by far one of the best.  It's very similar to the official US Army publication on survival, with a few differences.  This book is a bit thinner, but has more practical applications and details.  The illistrations are amazing.  I've picked up survival books at stores, thumbed through them, and put them back on the shelf due to a lack of illustrations.  How can you know how to make a shelter, trap, etc., without seeing it?  Well, this book makes it very easy to understand with simple written instructions alongside illustrations.</td></tr><tr><td>I read the tales of the city books years ago. Looked forward to the mini series and loved them. THis was like a glorious suprise reunion.  The book just flew... and let me catch up with lots of friends. as someone who has travelled and caught up with friends years later this was the exact feeling of the book. Probably not a great book on its own, but for alumnus of his books this is a little gem.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book!</td></tr><tr><td>I think the title of the book is misleading.  It is stories of the author's experiences and not very instructive or interesting. It was not very well written. Save yout time and money.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was so elegantly written, I felt a part of the characters lives.  I couldn't put it down!  Reading this book also brought to life the hardships immigrants like my own father had coming from Italy. My father was the same age as the characters in the book when he came to America.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the best, most informative book out there for any type of autoimmune disease. I suffer from 3 very complicated autoimmune diseases and this gives you history, symptoms, things to watch for, when to contact your doctor, and most importantly, things that you can do to manage and improve your heath with autoimmune disease. So much is out of my control. This book helped me to take charge of my health and control things that I can control. I refer to it often.</td></tr><tr><td>Great read - pulled me right in and I didn't stop until I read the whole series and the spin off books... very well paced and well developed characters!</td></tr><tr><td>Witty. Quick read. Worth every dime.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book during a recent trip to Canada.  Actually I read most of it on the long plane ride home.  It was a compelling story, finely written.  I was very moved in some places, especially the part about coming up with a burial dress (I don't cry often during books, but I cried when I read that part).  I like the idea of women banding together to overcome adversity, teaching and learning from each other.  I did find the scenes in Boston to be a bit weak and looked forward to the action returning to Canada.  But overall this book was highly entertaining and engrossing -- I recommend it wholeheartedly.</td></tr><tr><td>A great, laugh out loud read and unique approach from JC's best friend Biff.  Although purely fictional, it's a good guess on where he was and what he was doing between birth and 30.  More truth is said in jest.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a wonderful read. Takes a while to get used to some of the language, but that is part of its charm. Kept me engaged and waiting to see what would happen next. Another \"classic\" by Jane Austen.</td></tr><tr><td>This book didn't seem to have the story line I was used to.  I didn't care for it as much as some of his other books.</td></tr><tr><td>Great for little kids.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is easy to understand and the author's explanations are the best I've found in any book.  The \"level\" is lower than most university general chemistry books.  This text might be used at a community college or an AP level high school class.  Unlike most general chem books this one is easy to read I gave this book five stars because it does what it sets out to do. Get this book if you are a self learner or maybe if you are taking general chem and need a second book that is easier understand.  Read the explanation in this book.  Then you \"get it\" and then go to the bigger textbook for more details. There are MANY practice/homework problems.  More than in most books and the odd ones have answers.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a HUGE Julia Quinn fan but am usually very cynical about authors I'm unfamiliar with. However, All 3 authors of this book are outstanding!! Made me hold my breath on second and laugh out loud the next. Highly recommended!!</td></tr><tr><td>Well, North does it again. I thought this was more of a page turner than \"Mission Compromised\", and I hope that Ollie gives us some more.  Newman's wife gets kidnapped, and he is sent on yet another mission. Of course, it involves nukes!! You once again see this from all sides of the battle field, and it makes you want more! I liked how they have General Grisham back in this one, and Bruno Macklin as well.  In this there is a message of keeping the faith. An awesome, as well as an entertaining novel with a lot of faith. While it isn't always easy to keep the faith, North keeps the pages turning with a little blood and guts to make it very interesting! It doesn't get much better as far as military thrillers are concerned!</td></tr><tr><td>Beginning in 2014, there was a flurry of activity as we came up to the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. Poised to take advantage of the interest was the 2012 book The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 2014, by Christopher Clark, the Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge. Prior to reading this book, most of my knowledge of the outbreak of World War 1 probably came from The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchmans Pulitzer Prize winning book about the start of the war. Her book, which starts with a memorable scene of the funeral procession of King Edward VII, is mostly about the first month of the war (August 1914) with a brief part at the beginning about the diplomatic maneuvering and intrigues leading up to the war. And if I had to pick who was the focus of attention in this part of her book, I would have to say it was Kaiser Wilhelm II. Clarks book is different. It ends with the mobilization of armies and spends  its time with a deep dive into the history and diplomatic archives of the two countries whose dispute was the trigger point, Serbia and Austria. Just like Tuchmans book, Clarks book starts with a memorable scene involving the death of a monarch. In this case, it was June 11, 1903, when 28 officers of the Serbian Army invaded the royal palace in Belgrade, and shot and stabbed to death King Alexandar and Queen Draga, ending with them flinging the mutilated corpses out the window of the palace. With this as a backdrop, Clark then goes back and looks at the nationalistic tensions that developed in Serbia since its founding from a portion of the retreating Ottoman Empire. This included a multitude of plots and secret societies, all of which ultimately led up to Sarajevo in June, 1914. While Serbia thought that it should be the leader of all the South Slavic (Yugoslav) peoples, they were thwarted by the fact that the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary actually ruled over part of what Serbia desired (including Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia). So the second part of the book looks at the slow disintegration of Austria-Hungary and its amazingly complex political system that tried to tamp down ethnic tensions from the parts of the empire that weren't Austria and Hungary. Once the backstories of these two main players are established, he then works his way through the allies. On Serbias side, the Russian Empire backed them up as protectors of the Slavic people, with France allied with Russia (in what was primarily an anti-German alliance), and the slow shift of France and Great Britain to allies after centuries of being enemies. On the Austrian side was their fraternal alliance with Germany, with both empires growing out of the pieces of the Holy Roman Empire. But Russia, France, Great Britain, and Germany take up less of the book than the two instigators. If you want to learn more about the origins of World War I, this is a suitable book. Is it the best, the most even-handed? That I don't know, especially if you are trying to blame one side or another. or try to shift guilt away from your side. In my view, the author didn't try to assign guilt. In his words, It is concerned less with why the war happened than with how it came about. Again from the author \"The story this book tells is, by contrast, saturated with agency. The key decision-makers  kings, emperors, foreign ministers, ambassadors, military commanders and a host of lesser officials  walked towards danger in watchful, calculated steps. The outbreak of war was the culmination of chains of decisions made by political actors with conscious objectives, who were capable of a degree of self-reflection, acknowledged a range of options and formed the best judgements they could on the basis of the best information they had to hand. Nationalism, armaments, alliances and finance were all part of the story, but they can be made to carry real explanatory weight only if they can be seen to have shaped the decisions that  in combination  made war break out. (Kindle location 370).\"</td></tr><tr><td>Awesome!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>fantastic view of issues in the south.  I loved this book and the previous one of the trilogy.</td></tr><tr><td>As all of Liane Moriarty's books, The characters seemed so familiar from the beginning. I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed the book.</td></tr><tr><td>I have visited three of the infamous concentration camps of WWII and each time I felt that I was giving 'witness' to  one of the most  horrific inhumane time of recent history.  This book is based on fact; the time, the place, the names.  It is about the women  of the French Resistance and how they lived and died during their time in captivity.  How they came together to help and protect their 'sisters' and after their freedom they  told the author that that strong bond was paramount in getting them through the hell of the camps and the monsters running it.  Some of these women didn't make it and those who did gave the author the information to tell their incredible and brave story of  survival.</td></tr><tr><td>Any book about Alex Cross keeps me in suspense from start to finish. And again Alex dodges another catastrophe. But one day it won't be so.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a huge Hobbit fan from the book and even so from the movies. I also love graphic novels. All that being said, I just could not get into this book at all.</td></tr><tr><td>I have read every one of Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder stories and have thoroughly enjoyed them. As other reviewers have mentioned, Scudder evolves and matures in each adventure. In this one, he deals with a serial killer who alternates between killing boys and setting up a completely innocent person to take the fall-and die-for his crimes and attacking and killing women. Scudder, working on a case for a woman who wants to find out the background of her elusive boyfriend is unaware for a large part of the book that the killer is really after him and Elaine. The plot careens to an explosive and violent end. This Scudder adventure was sadly lacking. For one thing, I am very tired of the serial killer who is so brilliant that he defies most attempts to trace or even to know there is a serial killer. In reality I would hazard to guess that most of these people are not of that type; they manage to evade capture for many reasons and rarely because they are brilliant. This premise has, I think, been done to death. Also, the interspersion of the killer's thoughts was unsettling to the flow of the story. And lastly, the violence was off-putting. That said Block, even in a less than satisfying book, is a master and though disappointed quite early in the book, I couldn't put it down. His is a masterful writer and I do hope his next Scudder adventure is a better read.</td></tr><tr><td>Rivers of ink have been spilled over why the First World War broke out and who, if anyone, was to blame. Professor Clark's The Sleepwalkers, just when you thought nothing else could be added to the conversation, portrays the era leading up to the war and the crisis immediately resulting from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. His thesis is that the European system of alliances, the role of monarchs in most of the countries involved, the lack of international institutions like those we have today which could have militated against the breakdown in diplomacy, and the greater acceptance of war as a natural outcome of power politics in a heavily-armed continent made the outbreak of WWI a much more likely result of that crisis. In short, it was the system and not any one country or person who was guilty of what turned out to be an unspeakable catastrophe and the beginning of the end of Europe's global dominance. While richly detailed, the book is an easy read, and well worth the time taken. You will finish this book with a better understanding of how European countries interacted in the early 20th century and of international relations in general. Really first rate.</td></tr><tr><td>Taken at the Flood (a quotation from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar Act 5, scene III) is a 1948 Agatha Christie murder mystery featuring her ace Belgian Detective the inimitable Hercule Poirot. The book is an intricately plotted novel told with the brilliant style of Dame Christie writing at the top of her game. The Plot: Gordon Cloade is a wealthy millionaire who dies during the London Blitz. Rosaleen Cloade is his young widow. She was previously married to Captain Robert Underhay in South Africa before he was reported dead. Rosaleen was an actress who is beautiful but less than brilliant! She and her brother David Hunter arrive in the small English village where many members of the Cloade family reside. The family is upset thast it Rosaleen who will inherit the fortune left in Gordon's will. During the course of the novel there is a suicide, a murder by the administering of a lethal amount of morphine in place of a sleeping powder bromine. The book also includes a romantic triange in which Lynn Marchmont (niece of Gordon Coade) is loved by Rowley Coad and David Hunter. The mystery has many red herrings and surprise revelations. Not everyone is whom they seem to be. Lightweight but enjoyable reading for Agatha Christie buffs and mystery fans in general.</td></tr><tr><td>This book, 'The Whole Enchilada', is a very good read! I couldn't put it down! Fun,fun, fun and more fun!</td></tr><tr><td>Based upon contemporary and most credible evidence available to scholars, \"Misquoting Jesus\" provides insight for all who regard the Bible with interest or curiosity of any variety or perspective. Dr. Ehrman transforms tediously esoteric scholarship into logically connected and flowing, easily read and assimilated plain English. With Ehrman's guidance, a reader can follow evolution of the many translations now available -- from ancient texts to currently published editions. Although emphasis resides with New Testament translations and transitions, I find it difficult to imagine any layman not completing this book without experiencing a sense of new-found discovery and comprehension for the whole Bible. After completing this reading and thinking \"What else can he say?\" I was tempted skip the short afterword that had ben appended to the original edition. I'm thankful that I did not succumb to that impulse. The afterword contains a Q & A with the author, a section of readers' responses, notes upon some famous New Testament manuscripts that impacted current translations and understandings, and significantly, \"Top Ten Verses That Were Not Originally in the New Testament.\" The latter provides clear insight into why it is that one can authoritatively refer to \"evolution\" of the New Testament! Indeed, Ehrman makes it quite clear that when one asserts, \"The Bible says...,\" the next logical question might well be, \"Which Bible?\" That observation illuminates in stark relief any claim of so-called \"Bible inerrancy.\"</td></tr><tr><td>If you are a lover of fantasy, then you should definitely read this book. I was inspired to read this book after watching a movie. You'll jump into another world full of fantasy. Hard to forget!</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very enjoyable story but it is difficult to follow.  Most of the story line is composed of short chapters that jump between a French girl and a German boy caught in the grip of World War II.  Unfortunately the time line also jumps back and forth - 1944, '34, '44, '40, '44, ...  If you have to put the book down and pick it up another day, you can become easily confused. The book is very similar to \"The Book Thief\" - if you enjoyed that book you will probably enjoy this one.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book.</td></tr><tr><td>Can't go wrong with this staple</td></tr><tr><td>This is a tiny book that one can easily read in a few hours, apparently intended for those (90%) of the current US population for whom the name of Ulysses Grant is unrecognizable.  And as usual for a British author writing about American history, many of the facts are wrong and he feels compelled to compare Grant and his other American examples to British figures like Churchill, Wellington and Montgomery.   That being said, this would be a reasonable book to give a 8th grader to hopefully interest him in American history.  The writing is crisp and the prose flows easily.   Author Korda essentially relies on two (count 'em, TWO) sources for most of his work; the highly controversial McFeely with its many errors and the 1928 work by Woodward.  It does not seem as though Korda read Grant's superb autobiography, but he presents a very sympathetic portrait of Grant that might inspire further interest in his subject.   The best parts of the book are the author's depiction of Grant's childhood, his personal bravery, rock-solid marriage, liberal attitudes (at a time when the Republicans were liberal and the Democrats conservative), and the close of his life when he wrote his autobiography.  It is well-known that Grant was an abject business failure, putting the interests of others over his own, and showing a great deal of undeserved trust and loyalty.  Although Grant was an extreme example of a military man unable to function as a civilian businessman, one should remember that others such as Patton, Eisenhower, Pershing, Lee etc, were never so tested.  An uncommonly brave man, Grant saw and understood the tragedies of war and in spite of personal feelings was able to do his duty to the best of his abilities.   Author Korda mentions one of Grant's problems that has been overlooked by almost all historians and needs reinforcement.  Grant suffered frequently from debilitating migraine headaches, even almost missing Appromattox as a result.  Grant needed his wife or Rawlins when he was incapacitated by a headache, and they kept him isolated in a darkened tent or room until the headache ran its course.  Literally all of these episodes were recorded as Grant being drunk or sleeping off a hangover.  The incidence of Grant's drinking was probably a small fraction of what was reported, if at all.  It must be remembered that at the time, drinking was not considered as bad as having a mental disorder (like having frequent migraine headaches) and Grant himself apparently used drunkenness as a reason for his incapacitation rather than mentioning his headaches.   As far as judging Grant as a military commander or President, this book is simply inadaquate in scope to support the author's conclusions.  Nonetheless, he does not miss a reasoned and defensible scholarly analysis by far.  Grant did very well in the Civil War, displaying excellent strategic and tactical sense, and a firm understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents.  At Belmont he was only forced to withdraw when his green troops fell away to plunder the Confederate camp, and his campaigns against Fort Donelson and Vicksburg did not offer much opportunity for criticism.  He avoided defeat at Shiloh, won easily at Chattanooga, and was the Federal General to finally bring Lee to bay.   Historians have severely criticized his long casualty list in the 1864 campaign against Lee, but it must be remembered that Meade was in tactical command of the Army of the Potomac, not Grant.  An often overlooked item was Grant's elimination of prisoner exchanges.  Those exchanges worked to the disadvantage of the Federals due to their numerical superiority.  Grant's decision was also more humane; as he said, otherwise the only way to deny the Confederates its soldiers would be to kill them (thus raising battle deaths on both sides.)   As President, Grant was a calming influence, and he did forestall another war with England over Canada.  This is an episode overlooked by historians, but Palmerston had once thought of offering Canada to the US in return for recognizing the Confederacy and Canada was definitely in play.  Following the Civil War there was a great deal resentment against England for aiding the Confederacy and meddling in US internal affairs, and war over Canada could have easily resulted.  Yes, financial scandals rocked Grant's terms of office, but there were also many positive things that Grant contributed.  Unfortunately, scandals are much more popular among writers wishing to sell books.  A modern reader must surely understand that.   There are many mistakes in the book that are jarring.  George B. McClellan is repeatedly given as McClennan and the author makes statements such as; \"No American ex-president had ever fallen so low, and except for Harding and Nixon, none would ever again.\"  Well, sorry to say, Harding died in office and would never become an ex-president.  Also saying that \"...MacArthur can be thought of as a latter-day McClellan,...\" is simply ludicrous.  And finally, is it required for a writer to include a criticism of Bush  \"(...a sentiment that might usefully have been followed 133 years later by President George W. Bush)\" to get good reviews from the media?  Ok, I get it!!  You hate Bush!  Now can we please produce a scholarly historical work of times and personnel before the 21th century without making negative comments about Bush?   I finished the little book conflicted over this author's reasonable and sympathetic presentation of a much-loved American hero of the 19th century but containing his condescending British Empire attitude and contemporary political opinions.  In short, the author lost my good offices at the end.  I can readily see why this book is rated from 1 to 5 stars.  It all depends on the reader, so I compromised with three.</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and  well researched. The characters and locations became very realistic and true.</td></tr><tr><td>Great start to a new series. Loved it. Can't wait to read the next one.</td></tr><tr><td>The Way the Crow Flies is an excellent novel containing mystery and emotion. Although it is long, when you finish, you are disappointed that there isn't any more. A good read</td></tr><tr><td>Appears to be well researched and is written in an comfortable style.  Adds to the wealth of Marilyn information available.</td></tr><tr><td>Epic and extraordinary adventure romance!  My review on book 7.</td></tr><tr><td>Not very good characters shallow and convoluted reasons for keeping them apart...very disappointed ai usually love her books</td></tr><tr><td>I would have to say that John Green is quickly becoming one of my favourite authors. I loved Looking for Alaska. There is something about Green's writing that captures me. There is an honesty and a quirkiness that explores both huge themes and minute details. Pudge, who is obsessed with people's last words, is fed up with his life and goes to boarding school looking for the Great Perhaps. There he meets a whole new group of friends courtesy of his roommate, The Colonel. At the centre of them is Alaska, who is beautiful, smart and messed up. Pudge is a great character, someone so many teens can probably relate to on some level - looking for meaning in their life, trying to fit in, getting picked on, listless... Alaska, on the other hand, is feeling many of these same things, but goes about finding her answers in a whole different way. It is hard to say too much about this book without giving away the plot. I can say, though, that Green's writing is beautiful and engaging. He's got such a way with words, and this, along with his unique view of things, makes for great books. Each chapter has a countdown to a specific event, which certainly adds to the intrigue of the book as well as creates some urgency. I think teens, both boys and girls, will really enjoy this book. These are characters that stay with the reader for long after the book is finished. One thing to note: there is a lot of content that some people may find controversial such as drinking, smoking, and sex.</td></tr><tr><td>I love Elizabeth Lowell, but just couldn't connect with this one.  It was a little too twisted, and then all of the sudden, it was resolved in the last 10 pages.  But, I didn't care.  There were too many damaged peopled and you couldn't really believe in any of them.  Disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>Great series...can't wait to plow from one to the next.</td></tr><tr><td>One of Ed McBain's better efforts: the mystery is worth following and the characters, as always deeper than the pulp genre he is writing in.</td></tr><tr><td>Beauman's sequel is a fine addition to the de Winter story.  She captures Rebecca with all the grace, beauty, evil, and deceit that DuMaurier wrote about years ago.  It was neat to see the story from other people's point of view, especially Terrence Gray, Rebecca's half-brother.  Anyone who is a fan of DuMaurier's novel and Hill's sequel will enjoy this continuation of the story.  It brings closure to some things and opens doors to others.  It leaves the story open for another sequel, should so be desired, yet is a conclusion if no one does.  As a 'Rebecca' fan, I am glad to have this as part of my collection.  A must for book lovers!</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting book, and the author learned everything, and hopefully he will become a senator and help the drugs, environments, and the other people who need help to learn work, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Having grown up with works of Roman history, I picked up Colleen McCullough's First Man In Rome, looking forward to an entertaining and lively read. The First Man In Rome is the beginning of her Master's Of Rome series. And it is a jewel. Her in-depth scholarly research in no way impedes her creating characters that come alive through her cunning depictions and her wise perception of what drives the thirst for power. Background: Gaius Marius, onetime praetor of Rome, is wealthy and restless. Hailing from Arpinium, he is considered a New Man-meaning non-patrician, therefore he cannot hope to climb the Cursus Honorarium, and become a senator or stand for consul. Caesar, who lives next door to Gaius Marius is a Julian, with a noble history dating back to the founding of Rome. His wife Marcia has given him two beautiful daughters (Julia and Julilla) and two sons (Sextus and Gaius Caesar.) Noble the Julians are, they are impoverished, and Caesar cannot hope to have at least one of his sons stand for Senator. Lucius Cornelia Sulla is an enigma. Though noble through the ancient gens Cornelia, his father, a drunkard, frittered away what little money there had been, and Sulla ended up being raised in the Subura, where the poorest of Rome's citizens dwelt. This background has forbidden him his rightful place amongst Rome's patrician classes, and the right to stand for Senator. McCullough's skillful interweaving of these three men and their families is handled with credibility and compassion. Though many of her characters are not totally likeable, she refrains from using tricks, or inserting her own judgements about these people. The First Man In Rome is so thoroughly entertaining, once started, it's very hard to put down. This is no dry dusty treatise about this chapter in Rome's long history. It is a novel filled with fully human dimensions and depth, love, hate, corruption, greed and treachery. Her grasp of politics and its attendant manipulations is enormous. This quote in particular from Gaius Marius is memorable for it's inherent truth: \"There are no rules. And you don't even know who-let alone where-your enemies are. Give me a battlefield for an arena anytime! At least what happens on it is quick and clean-and the best man usually wins. But the Senate of Rome is a brothel stuffed with the lowest forms of life and the lowest form of conduct\" \"And if anyone is naive enough to think that political intrigue doesn't ruin more lives than any war, then he deserves anything politics dishes out to him\" The Roman women of that time are treated either with love and affection or in other cases, simply as property. Reminiscent of the way many women are still regarded today, some of the women are brilliant and yet, have no place to exercise their fine minds. Only one character, Aurelia, tosses tradition to the side and becomes a much beloved force to be reckoned with. If you are looking for a fast paced, delightful book, filled with memorable people, epic battle scenes and political intrigue, I cannot recommend this book, nor indeed the entire series highly enough. McCullough has thoughtfully provided a rich Glossary and a short guide to the names and their pronunciation, along with maps and line drawings taken from actual Roman busts. The First Man In Rome is a keeper, one you'll return to again and again, when wanting something to carry you through the long cold nights of winter.</td></tr><tr><td>This books up where 'Summer at the Comfort Food Cafe\" left off.  It was an enjoyable read, however, I did feel that the author repeated a lot of the same content that was in the first book.  I understand that she wanted to make it so a reader could start with either book & know what was going on, but it was almost too repetitive.  Regardless, I enjoyed catching up with the characters & getting to know Becca.  Ms. Johnson does a good job of describing the scenery & characters.  You feel like you are right there with the folks in the cafe, looking out at the beach and eating one of Laura's yummy creations.  Hopefully, there will be another story coming!</td></tr><tr><td>There were many late nights waiting on something to get done that could of and should have been given to a subordinate that wasn't ... time management is a key skill and knowing how to utilize your people is even more important.  There's a reason you're in a position of authority... not to abuse it, but to use it... to make the company run smoother!  this book teaches ways to enhance that... As a leader you are no good to those that work for you if you are to busy doing their work to help them.  LET them do their work and assist them... don't do it for them and ignore them.  If they cant handle th work, find someone who can</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this book thinking (for some reason) it was the first in the Lord Peter Whimsey novels. Its not  its like the eleventh or something. But I didn't figure that out until I was three or four chapters in, and by then, I didn't want to quit. Sayers is a great writer (if a little dense at times), and her mix of lighthearted humor, literary roots, and understanding of human nature makes for a compelling set of stories. This volume, dealing as it did with the honeymoon of the Whimseys, has a fair bit of really excellently written and clearly-thought-out stuff about sex, which Ive hardly ever encountered. It was all very tasteful and oblique, and I appreciated it very much. Overall, it was funny, clever, insightful, and thoroughly enjoyable. I should read the others.</td></tr><tr><td>Ernet Hemingway's first book is still my favorite, capturing the zeitgeist of a Lost Generation ... and lost love. Could I ever write a book this good? Not likely ... but wouldn't it be pretty to think so.</td></tr><tr><td>Great story and pretty good history.  I live where it happened.</td></tr><tr><td>Enjoyed the plot twists. Agood story with nice character development,</td></tr><tr><td>I found this memorior very wonderful.  Your heart gets wrapped up in this  mans childhood.  You find yourself engrossed in his heart-wrenching tale of  his personal experiences.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered!!!! It was a  wonderful way to spend the day because that's how long it took me to read  it.</td></tr><tr><td>Used this for a class in college.  Was the book I needed for cheap...</td></tr><tr><td>Great ending to the series. It caught you up on things you might have forgotten from previous books so you knew what was going on in this book. Great closure.</td></tr><tr><td>This was a well written book. I liked Hilary Mantel's first book,\"Wolf Hall\"!Found this to be a great continuation of the story! This is a favorite time in History for me and I hope to read more of Mantel's books!</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting read, good story...true? Strange ending</td></tr><tr><td>I grew up in the south, and I can tell you--he totally nailed the southern dialect.  Outstanding character development too.  Loved it.  I will be reading more of his books, for sure.</td></tr><tr><td>Gregory Maguire has put a most clever twist on this incredibly rich and creative retelling of the classic story of Snow White. In a seamless blending of history and fairy tale, the story takes place in 16th century Italy. Snow White is personified as Bianca, the beautiful and naive daughter of a Spanish expatriate who manages the Montefiore farm. Lucrezia Borgia, the decadent, beautiful, and manipulative murderess, replaces the role of the wicked stepmother as Bianca's caretaker. The seven dwarves are creatures far stranger than any I have ever seen depicted before. Part man, part rock, and wholly surreal, they move through their own dimensions of time and space. The poisoned apple is plucked from the fabled tree of knowledge. The language is lyrical and evocative of far away times and places. Objects ranging from the mirror to the dwarves' cottage are painted with detail so realistic yet magical that the reader is immersed in the off-kilter and eerie world of fantasy. Colorful secondary characters such as the cook, priest, and gooseboy add humorous contrast to the evil machinations of the Borgias. Take a trip to Montefiore and revisit a fairy tale reflected in a mirror of history, myth, and magic.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent book about submarines and their role in history. We read it for our Book Club and our guest was one of the gentlemen that served about the USS Halibut!!</td></tr><tr><td>This book stands out as one of the very few examples where I liked the movie BETTER than the book. For some reason, it fell somewhat flat to me. The story is charming, but translated to film much better in my opinion. I read this immediately after finishing American Gods, and believe me... it was something of a letdown!</td></tr><tr><td>This is my favorite Dr. Suess book, and although its themes are a little more advanced, its still a book i give to all new babies born in my life. Everyone needs this book, and needs to read and understand the importance.</td></tr><tr><td>You really like Odd Thomas.  He is a character that you enjoy following through his trials and successes.</td></tr><tr><td>I was extremely excited to begin reading this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will pick up the next novel in the series.</td></tr><tr><td>I first read this book in High School and still pick it up to reread every once in a while.  It is not likely to win any prizes for literature, but I still find myself completely absorbed in it time and time again. I have read most of Sidney Sheldon's books, and Rage of Angels is my favorite. Jennifer is more sympathetic to me than many of Sidney Sheldon's other main characters.  I won't give away any spoilers, but she faces a moral dilemma where any mother should be able to understand her choice.  Even as a high school girl (without kids), I could empathize. For those that have not read anything by Sydney Sheldon, this is not a 'light-hearted romp'.  It is a page-turner, and I highly recommend it, but if you are looking for a Romance Novel this is not it.</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not sure which is worse, this book, or the fact that it's getting positive reviews on Amazon.com. This novel is a nonsensical, ill-written mish-mash of the worst b-movie stereotypes. It has rogue government agents, exotic locations, devious turncoats, an omnipotent evil organization, and, let's see, what else? Oh yeah, a deadly evil virus that threatens to wipe out the world. Ohh, scary. It's like the author went to the airport bookshelf, took one element from every bad King, Koontz and Chrichton novel and bound it together with a plot he pulled out of Tom Clancy's garbage can. I'd also have to guess that the villanous secret organization, The Guild (ohh, great name), was based on a cross between Inspector Gadget's M.A.D. and G.I. Joe's COBRA. Unfortunately, the cartoon villains end up being more realistic and scary than Rollins's horrendously written bad guys. This is the worst sort of light reading because in addition to being poorly written, stupid and cliche', it's also dim witted. Avoid at all costs, there are plenty of well written thrillers.</td></tr><tr><td>Good reading.</td></tr><tr><td>the author james rollins is a great author, his sigma series books are alot of fun to read. I totally enjoy the way he writes a novel</td></tr><tr><td>This is a timeless fictional story about a non-conforming seagull named Jonathan Livingston Seagull. It is an unusual little book as it is a story from a seagull's point of view. The book was written by Richard Bach (b. 1936). A former US Air Force pilot, many of his books contain flight references. The book is very short - about 100 pages - many of which comprise photographs of gulls. It caused quite a stir when it was first published in 1970. This best seller is a classic and is still on many schools' reading lists. The story is about Jonathan's passion to fly like no other seagull against all odds. He is different from other gulls who exist merely to eat and survive. He wants to learn to fly higher and faster than anyone else. He constantly improves by teaching himself new techniques. Each time he `fails' he moves to a higher level of awareness. He eventually reaches a plane where he finds many gulls with the same mindset. He is encouraged and motivated to continue to excel and ultimately learns to fly beyond his wildest expectations. His self development and personal growth keep him focused on his search for a higher purpose, and through persistence and perseverance he finally achieves his goal. As his reputation builds so does a `following' but he remains humble, speaking of simple things, such as  \"the right for a gull to fly\"  and  \"freedom.\" His followers consider him  \"special and gifted and divine, above all other birds.\"  He explains to them that they all are. There are some great phrases like: \"The gull who sees farthest who flies highest\". \"Everything that limits us we have to put aside\". \"You need to keep finding yourself, a little more each day...\". \"...you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way\". This novel is about attaining your dreams and being your own self development mentor. Jonathan shows that through sheer tenacity and perseverance you can overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. On a deeper level, it explores man's inherent desire for personal development and self growth, and the search for true happiness. Deeper still, it touches on our materialistic life being not the end but the beginning of something even greater. As you read you realise that Jonathan Seagull lives within everyone. What are his teachings? * Live and love your life's passions. * Give yourself the freedom to soar. * Never ever give up on your passions. * Allow yourself to listen to your heart. * Have faith and pursue your true purpose. * You can do anything if you want it enough. * Follow your dreams through thick and thin. * Dare to question what is taught by your elders. * It is all right to be different from everyone else. * Do not follow others blindly - fly out on your own. * Keep working on your talents and fly to new heights. * It is your choice to live your life exactly the way you want. * Follow your dreams even if others find your ideas ridiculous. * Break through the restraints of family, friends and community. * Figure out what your greatest talents are and truly live your life. * Hard as it may sound, do not be concerned over what others think. * There is always something great to be learned from trying new things. * Listen to your dreams and persevere until you get to where you want to be. IN SUMMARY 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' is about far more than the life of one seagull. It is a fable about self empowerment and the importance of seeking a higher purpose in life, even if the people around you find your goals threatening or ridiculous. Jonathan shows that you can do anything and be anything you want if you just believe in yourself. It is also about the struggle to find the answers about life itself. This book is a great read for all age-groups and particularly for anyone who wants to `fly' in the broadest sense of the word. It is a book that can be read a number of times with each reading giving you further insight. It is also a good fable for children as it stimulates discussions on the various meanings of the story. The ending was slightly puzzling but on viewing the DVD which, though very lengthy (2 hrs), did suggest some explanations. The film also shed light on why the book had numerous black and white, grainy photographs of gulls.  (All the music and songs are by Neil Diamond)</td></tr><tr><td>Wasn't impressed by the writing or the story.  Lacked substance.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is on a topic of great interest to me, the spiritual evolution of the universe.  It is however a difficult read. The translation is very cumbersome. This is why I rated it four stars instead of 5.</td></tr><tr><td>The best collection of books one can find.  While waiting for the next installment I will just have to read them all over again!</td></tr><tr><td>Our 17 year old, my husband and I are all reading this at the same time on different devices. It's so good! You have to listen to it being read, he is so good!</td></tr><tr><td>You have to read the whole series to follow the story line but it is well worth the time spent</td></tr><tr><td>We love this book and keep giving it as gifts.  My son has it memorized and can recite most of it.</td></tr><tr><td>The Other Side of Truth, an astonishingly powerful novel by Beverly Naidoo, illustrates a passionate, yet harrowing story of two Nigerian children (Sade and Femi) striving to overcome their struggle for justice and freedom of speech as they are left abandoned by their beloved ones in England.  The novel unwraps describing the gruesome murder of their mother, a memory that is forever remembered in the thoughts/dreams of these children.  Such remembered words of wisdom are used to motivate these children as they experience their fascinating adventure about courage, family and the power of truth.  I really appreciate Naidoo's incorporation of the multiple themes demonstrated in this novel such as injustice, freedom of speech and the complextities of political asylum.  Additionally, I am really delighted to understand how Naidoo wrapped detail upon detail around the bare skin of the novel to portray how Sade and Femi found inspiration from their surroundings in England and used their creative minds to reunite with their father who was confined from expressing his journalistic views about the corrupted governmental society.  Naidoo kept me interested, making me ponder about the end of this novel.  First, I figured that Sade's mother's death would only lead to an unsuccessful life for Sade and Femi, but realized that only through this did these children have the opportunity to come face to face with the realities of life.  Overall, The Other Side of Truth expresses the actualities of the lifestyle in Nigeria and how the struggles these children face empower them to express their own freedom of speech in order to survive.  So, I recommend this book to all individuals from grades 5-12 who desire reading novels that entail the life struggles of children and their journey to express their freedom of truth during difficult time periods.</td></tr><tr><td>Another long book that was a joy to read. Held my interest throughout.  Very informative and inspiring. I enjoyed the author's style.</td></tr><tr><td>Well written and tender without being maudlin. Definitely recommended. The author manages to bring the story along, giving away just enough to keep the reader interested.</td></tr><tr><td>Love it, Amazon continues to be the best site for me to acquire anything I need and much more regardless of the item</td></tr><tr><td>A very touching but very real story.  If you have a \"Manic\" in your family or if you know one this book is an informative, emotional read.  If you don't it will help you to understand the mind of someone suffering from Bi Polar illness.  It is written in a way that feels more than tells and you won't be sorry you chose this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved it!</td></tr><tr><td>I thought the story well written and interesting, but I especially enjoyed the observations of people and culture. The added layer of the non American perspective was fascinating. This really held my interest. The narrator was fantastic. Adjoa Andoh really brought Ifemelu to life and simultaneously conveyed a multitude of other characters very successfully.</td></tr><tr><td>Stay away from Pharmaceuticals, they are not magic they are toxic, with side effects. Learn what foods help your particular issue. I have used this book for years and it works! Most culture's food is designed for the pharmaceutical effect as well as nutrition, i.e. hot peppers are full of vitamin C and great to keep you healthy. Use the glossary and read what is of interest and concern to you and then go shopping in your kitchen or at the store, and solve your illnesses not just your symptoms. And note your body was quietly trying to tell you it needed that! Get healthy and save your money! Loved this book for years so I had to have it on my Kindle so it was with me when visiting friends!</td></tr><tr><td>SO FORTUNATE TO READ ANOTHER ANN PATCHETT NOVEL.  THIS WAS AN EARLIER CREATION, BUT VERY, VERY GOOD!  WILL READ EVERYTHING SHE HAS WRITTEN TO DATE.</td></tr><tr><td>I believe this is one of Bonhoeffer's earlier books, written on the heels of his experience of an (almost) underground Christian community at Finkenwalde during the time of the Third Reich in Germany.  His insights into the internal (and external) battle between good and evil, i.e. the true cost of discipleship - cheap vs. costly grace and the daily discipline required of the Christian living in the world - at that time a world dominated by a \"religion\" of racism and hatred, were astounding for one so young.  And one so brave.  He didn't shy away from those tough questions. Dietrich Bonhoeffer lived his faith and died because he refused to shy away from the tough choices his faith required of him.  Like its author, this book is a gem for humanity.</td></tr><tr><td>All I need to get me thru airports and business travel is a comfortable paperback, preferably a mystery.  This one did the trick!  It was not the heavy tome of a P. D. James or Elizabeth George, all of whom I have read, but it did elicit the English dynamic as does Deborah Crombie.  Two American writers who give us a fairly short procedural to figure out. I must admit the solution to this mystery came out of the blue; perhaps I am critical because I just never figured out who it would be - in other words I didn't have a clue!!!! :D Hamish as a sidekick (conscience) is a different ploy. But I liked Inspector Ian Rutledge and I hope he grows as I continue to read this series.  Picked up Charles Todd on these review boards - am so glad I did. I never even suspected the killer; a plus for me even tho it was a bruise to my ego!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>My teenage daughter has gotten hooked on Sherlock Holmes and become both an avid reader and viewer of his adventures. It is hard to find a single volume containing all of the adventures of the Great Detective.  Harder still to find one that is both well presented and reasonably priced.  This book meets all those criteria. I know that my daughter loves her copy almost as much as she adores the acerbic wit and insight of the \"Consulting Detective\" himself.</td></tr><tr><td>This book (the first in a series of 15 so far) and its' author are surrounded by hype - I believed the hype and bought the book (instead of borrowing it from the library), I'm not saying it's a bad book, it's just not as \"spectacular\" as some reviews claimed it was. I will definitely read the rest of the books in the series but I seriously doubt I will buy any more of them. The plot was slightly unbelievable - a woman gets fired, can't afford to pay her bills and has to sell most of her furniture to afford to buy food. She decides her best job prospect is to become a bounty hunter and chase down a murder suspect, who happens to be an ex-cop and lust (if not love) interest since they were children. At times I found it hard to suspend my disbelief at some of the things she did but despite this it was an amusing read.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved it! Great second book. An a ending i didn't expect! Ages 12+ will be happy with this book! Supercalifragilisticexpalidocous!</td></tr><tr><td>Bought for my son, he loves the series</td></tr><tr><td>The story is fantastic, as long as someone isn't trying to force their interpretation down your throat. The copy I purchased through Amazon was not in good condition.</td></tr><tr><td>Last night, I closed All the Light I Cannot See and asked myself, what the heck happened to this beautiful novel? (OK I didn't say heck, just trying to keep it clean.) This WWII blockbuster opens with two riveting story lines. Werner, an orphan German teen is recruited by the Nazi's for his invaluable radio engineering skills, and Marie-Laure, a blind French girl - separated from her adoring father in war-torn France.  Right from the beginning, the reader knows that the lives of these two potentially fascinating characters will intersect. The novel also has some captivating scenes, all beautifully written.  There's Marie-Laure reading aloud from her braille edition of 20,00 Leagues Under the Sea,  there's the ominous agenda inside Werner's exclusive Nazi training school, and then, if you're like me, you'll hold your breath as messages are passed along, hidden in freshly baked bread, and then secretly broadcast from a short-wave radio hidden in the attic of a crumbling house perched on the edge of the sea.  Everything is there -- all the elements of a well-written and exciting WWII adventure. And so you settle in, cup of tea in hand and eagerly start reading...and reading...and reading -- through 178 chapters.  Yes, you read that right -- 178 chapters! Therein lies the first problem  -- 178 short chapters, many only a few pages, which jerk the reader back in forth in time, often with no clue to the year.  The choppy chapters and abrupt time jumps are not only confusing, they actually prevented me from really sinking into the story.  One reviewer, knowing that Mr. Doerr is a much better writer than this, surmised his editors insisted on shuffling the timeline.  The format did feel gimmicky and like an afterthought.  I'd go even further, I think those same editors also insisted on chopping the novel into short chapters to cater to today's 140-character-tweet-text-snapchat-attention-span readers (That just wrote itself in the throes of my rant - like it?). Now we come to the second problem,  All the Light We Cannot See starts out beautifully written and compelling, but then it just seems to fall apart --  rather it just never comes together. Werner's and Marie-Laure's paths, while coming teasingly close, never really converge.  And when they do finally intertwine, they are only together for 10 pages towards the end.  Then fast forward 30 years and the book ends not with a bang but with a whimper (my apologies to T. S. Eliot). The novel won Pulitzer Prize, earned many glowing reviews and many weeks on the bestseller lists. Perhaps I missed something magical in my reading of  this book.  Maybe it was my mood. Whatever the reason, I was underwhelmed and sadly disappointed upon finishing this novel. A digital review copy was provided by Scribner via NetGalley. See all my book reviews at Bookbarmydotcom</td></tr><tr><td>OUTSTANDING BOOK ... I highly recommend all that Donald J. Trump said in this book. However, there is a writer who also is quoted at the end of each chapter summarizing what Mr. Trump said. I did not care to read what the writer said. My interest was only learning from Mr. Trump's philosophy and his own experiences. The book was inspirational, instructive, interesting, and with a positive tone that provided ways of going about improving one's own life. Again I highly recommend the book and would buy it again. Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>Frances de Pontes Peebles has written a large novel, I'd say above average in length compared to most debut novels, which usually run too long also. After the first few paragraph of 'The Seamstress' I was immediately reminded of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's writing. By this I mean extremely wordy with lots of adjectives and rife with symbolism. I would not be surprised at all if Marquez was a large influence on de Pontes Peebles' writing style. I am a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and if you have read and enjoyed his novels then you would most likely enjoy this book as well. I gave 'The Seamstress' three stars because it is an intriguing story line and despite beginning with several elaborate metaphors is easy to get into and keeps you engaged. However, it does become overly verbose fairly often and indeed is a good bit too long. This seems to be a trend among debut novels and new authors. I do sense great potential in future writings and look forward to her next endeavor.</td></tr><tr><td>Not at all what i expected. Really love this book. Modern twist of Frankenstien well written. Highly Recommend if you like suspense.</td></tr><tr><td>Quick shipping, item as described, Thanks</td></tr><tr><td>As a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, it was almost refreshing to see Scarpetta in a new light. When I finished reading BLACK NOTICE, I knew Scarpetta was in for a change because of the tragedies she'd encountered. Cornwell didn't leave me hanging -- changes and more changes for my favorite heroine, Kay Scarpetta. Cornwell twisted this tough medical examiner inside out, upside down, and all around until she resembled a discarded latex glove. With THE LAST PRECINCT, we see all sides of Scarpetta, including a deeper look into what makes her tick and what ticks her off. With the world against her, her job on the line, being framed for a vicious murder, and old memories getting in the way,  Scarpetta must finally do what she's never been able to do before, lean on others and let them help her. Unfortunately, even those who only have good intentions for Scarpetta, end up hurting her -- friends, family, and even her co-workers all discover a newer, more vulnerable Kay. I'm excited about this new direction for Kay Scarpetta and you will be too, when you read THE LAST PRECINCT.</td></tr><tr><td>This book falls into the category of \"I feel bad for people that can't enjoy this book.\" I picked it up as a recommendation from someone and I'm so glad I did. It's fun, witty, reckless, decadent, and makes you look at the world more creatively. I had several laugh-out-loud moments reading this book. Since I was a theater major in college (now a computer programmer), the concept of a teacher that was both crazy, sadistic, and pushed you past your limits in ways you could not have imagined really struck a cord with me. Put all these reviews aside, read the book, and have a good time.</td></tr><tr><td>This review is a general one on the books related to Pug and not just specifically to this book. I have read quite a lot of Raymond Feist books, and maybe it was because I've read them all recently and in a short time span (and not when they were first published, some many years ago like the Magician in 1982), hence I find the story repetitive and predictable.  At the same time, I haven't read any of the newer published ones, so things may have changed.  Might take a look after completing my current list of books to read.</td></tr><tr><td>My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small, so I read it in one sit...It changed my life. It talks about life, love, friendship, death, etc. All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for...are in this book. It tells you all of these things that you already know about life, but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don't have to do the right thing, as if ignoring them will make us more human by default. There is no place that I go that this book doesn't follow me. I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said \"The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran\" and she got all excited too and said \"That's my favorite book too, it's like my Bible\"...I remember thinking \"How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?\"...I guess that's the thing about life...I will never forget that or her...</td></tr><tr><td>this was such an important book in my teenage years.  bought it for my 14 year old son hope it holds up</td></tr><tr><td>Catchy storyline with fun twists and turns.  Less engaging teeny love angst.</td></tr><tr><td>When I read the line that talked about the fact that my mother, aunt and other ladies I knew growing up had not had weight issues and had not exercised..it all fell into place.  Thanks for writing this most informative book!</td></tr><tr><td>Great</td></tr><tr><td>Yet another masterly story of times gone by, mostly fictional but also with  a lot of fact of the making of England. No one does it better than bernard cornwell</td></tr><tr><td>This is the second Ehrman book that I have read. I too believe that when you consider all the arguments for and against god that suffering and evil in the world are critical ones. Bart makes a logical progression from the most obvious reasons for suffering such as punishment for sin or teaching a lesson, to less obvious justifications that are intimately tied to doctrinal issues (redemptive suffering and testing faith), to other biblical perspectives (apocalyptic grounds). Like any theory, no one explanation for suffering covers all cases of suffering and some are even contradictory. For suffering to be \"rational\" it should have an objective (that humans can appreciate). What good does it do a person or a people when they severely punished to the point of debilitation (or death) when a milder form of consequence would have done the trick?  The eternal suffering in hell has no redemptive or corrective value--can god be eternally upset with a person whom he designed to be weak and prone to temptation? More disturbing, is this the god we are supposed to model? Doesn't \"loving\" mean just enough correction to bring one back on the right path? Suffering and evil can only exist in the world if god permits them. While Christians may say it is a mystery that will be explained in the next life, it is hard to image a reason why innocent children and masses of normal people all over the world suffer in their everyday existence, who are no more evil than you or me. In the end there may be no answer for suffering other than naturalistic explanations of which many happen (from our limited perspective) randomly.</td></tr><tr><td>Following the thread of truth through the jumble of war's realities, memories before the war, and fantasy flights, the reader discovers knots of wisdom about the absurdity of fate.</td></tr><tr><td>When I went to amazon.com, I found 954 reviews with myriad comments added to the reviews, so this story has sparked incredible discussions. I wasn't going to add my piece, but when I awoke this morning, I knew exactly where the points of the author's betrayal to his own story began. David Wroblewski said it took him a long time to write this book. I can believe that. He also thanks a tremendous number of people for reading his manuscript while writing it, never mind the editor and his wife. I now suspect he wrote from his \"muse,\" not the plot, as I did, and lack of plot was a major flaw in my first novel. The muse did not betray him. The people who guided him to create that ending did. Foremost among these has to be the editor. And Stephen King didn't get it either in his comments about the book. Are these people so mesmerized by the macabre that they fail to recognize the true genius of the story buried in this author's mind? The foreshadowing was there for a quite different resolution. I now understand where the muse was going and what the ending was meant to be. Now I will add my comments to those already published. I don't know if the author reads reviews of his book. I've read all of mine, the good and the bad, and I learned some valuable things from some critical reviewers, even befriended one. FLAW ONE: The sheriff, Glen Papineau. The author went out of his way to make the reader understand that this man was not as stupid as his peers thought he was. Because he was huge, he looked like an \"oaf.\"So, there is no way that Claude could have manipulated him to use ether to subdue Edgar in order \"to talk to him.\" Glen, as a former wrestler, didn't need a drug to control the much smaller boy. He could have just lifted him up and carried him off. Or used standard police moves to \"cuff\" him. We know that Edgar was just as eager to talk to Glen as Glen was to talk to Edgar--their mutual desire foreshadowed a scene where the two could have expressed their grief for their fathers. So, the scene where Glen uses ether to knock out Edgar in the barn and Edgar's struggle to get away and then ends up blinding Glen with the lime he threw at him is FALSE--CONTRIVED. FLAW TWO: When he was on the run, Edgar taught Essay and the other two dogs, Tinder and Baboo, to \"guard\" an object as they did when they surrunded the little girl and wouldn't let her move. All Edgar had to do to make sure Claude couldn't interfere with his removing his father's files from the burning barn was order Essay to \"guard\" Claude. Then Edgar would have found the poison at the back of the last filing cabinet. At this point, the author has two choices: let the fire interfere so that Edgar can't save the last files and see Claude punished for his crime but have his mother believe him so Claude is sent away and mother and son carry on with raising these wonderful dogs; or retrieve the proof to show that Claude killed his father and Glen/Edgar enjoy the satisfaction of imprisoning Claude. FLAW THREE: The dogs were trained and bred to be loyal. Essay would not have abandoned Edgar's mother, who loved them as much as Edgar did, to herd all the dogs in the confusion and guide them out to the wild. Have Forte's pups--yes--and thus add a new dimension to the Sawtelle dogs' breeding and genetics. This is the logical outcome. The author's muse was going toward an inspired ending, but something got in its way--perhaps marketing sensationalism to increase book sales is the twist introduced by the author's influencers, and not being confident enough as a debut writer, he didn't defend his muse, his own vision. Too bad because this should have been an all-time great classic of the  21st Century. And shame on Oprah for letting language and incredible imagery overpower her good sense. By betraying his own muse, the author did not deserve her Book Club Award.</td></tr><tr><td>Don't get me wrong.  It's a good book.  It spends a lot of time on new characters when there are so many questions on the other ones.</td></tr><tr><td>I am still not sure how I feel about this book. I appreciate Vance's candor and opening up parts of his life for the reader to explore and think about. However, in too many ways it feels too simplistic and too...whiny (for lack of a better term, because that isn't really it, maybe excusing is a more accurate word.) I think many people can probably see members of their own families or communities in many of Vance's family members regardless of where they live because what Vance presents is a bit of nostalgia for days gone by. And maybe those days aren't quite as gone by in many parts within this country for some. I certainly saw many of my family members and people I grew up with in the people introduced in the book. I don't think many of the issues (drug addiction, domestic violence, hard living, tough folks who'd just as soon shoot a person than talk it out, etc...) are exclusive to Appalachia. White apologetics have certainly gotten a lot of attention of late so I may not be giving this book its due. It does highlight the desperate poverty of poor white country folk and it is incredibly raw as a tale of a first-generation college student and the things he did not know as he embarked on his collegiate journey. I also really appreciated the brief exploration of his military time - I think this is often undervalued as a legitimate and valuable transition into adulthood. I think there are many things for many readers to identify with in this book - but I was left with thinking that there are more similarities between the people he wrote about and poor people of color than differences and I wish that would have been explored (although, I realize that was not his goal or even an area of expertise he felt he had.) So...overall, insightful for some no doubt. And maybe I feel like so much of this book mirrors my own life in different ways.</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely love this.</td></tr><tr><td>so good.</td></tr><tr><td>A Perfect Blood (2012) is the tenth Fantasy novel in the Rachel Morgan series, following&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pale-Demon/dp/0061138061/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pale Demon</a>.  The initial work in this series is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dead-Witch-Walking/dp/0060572965/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dead Witch Walking</a>. In the previous volume, Rachel was sunning herself in the backyard and helping Jenks pick colors to decorate his room.  She would be leaving Cincinnati to go to the coven meeting in San Francisco.  Trent appeared and wanted to travel with Rachel to the west coast. Then somebody shot a spell at Trent with a splat gun, but missed.  A foaming yellow mass of magic formed on a tree.  Rachel pulled him down and made a protection circle.  She sent pixies after the assassin. In this novel, Rachel Morgan had been a witch.  Then she was shunned by the Coven of Moral and Ethical Standards and learned demon magic from Al.  Now she is listed in official records as a demon. Ivy Tamwood is a living vampire.  She is also Rachel's roommate.  They have been living together for a few years, learning how to avoid angering each other. Jenks is a pixie.  He is a partner in the firm of Vampiric Charms and is now the owner of the church where they are living.  He was married to Matalina and now is taking care of about four dozen children on his own. Algaliarept is a demon.  Al had been after Rachel for some time and had taken her as an apprentice.  Now he thinks she is dead. Glenn is a Detective in the Federal Inderland Bureau.  His father had been the Captain of the FIB office in Cincinnati.  He is now dating Ivy. Wayde Benson is Rachel's bodyguard.  He had been working for Takata, Rachel's biological father.  After she was blocked from accessing ley lines, he was assigned to guard Rachel. Ninotchka Romana Ledesma is a living vampire working at the DMV office.  Nina has been forgotten by her master. In this story, Rachel is at the DMV trying to get her car registered and a driving license for herself.  As usual, the clerk finds that she is as dead and declares that nothing can be done until she is properly registered.  Rachel is getting frustrated. Wayde is driving Rachel wherever she desires to go, but she wants to be able to drive her car.  As they are leaving the office, Rachel is summoned on the PA system.  They turn back and go to window G.  She is let through the counter into a back hall. A vampire in a black dress suit is sitting behind a desk.  Nina is excited and nervous.  Then she is possessed by an old dead vampire.  The male vampire refuses to give his own name, but says to call him Nina. The old vampire is probably the local chief of Inderland Security in Cincinnati.  He wants her to help capture a small group of Inderlanders committing demonlike crimes.  He asks Rachel to meet him at the scene of the crime. A transformed body is strung up in a gazebo within a city park.  Blood is plentiful, but not enough for the murder to have been done at that location.  Then Wayde notices that the lines holding up the body are tied with HAPA knots. The Humans Against Paranormals Association had arisen after the Turn.  Now they are supposed to have been suppressed.  Evidently their demise is only propaganda. Rachel realizes that HAPA crimes are within the jurisdiction of FIB, not the IS.  She texts Glenn and FIB agents soon appear.  The IS is not happy with Rachel. The IS has been sitting on these crimes for weeks.  Their paperwork is sloppy and has no technical information.  FIB starts collecting further evidence from the crime scene. This tale has Rachel, Ivy and Jenks working with FIB.  Rachel gets into her usual troubles, but now she is wearing an amulet that blocks her ley-line magic.  She can't remove it herself and is reluctant to have it removed since an angry Al would soon appear. Rachel quickly learns to regret the amulet.  The next installment in this series is not yet announced on Amazon. Highly recommended for Harrison fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of various magics, domestic terrorism, and personal growth.  Read and enjoy! -Arthur W. Jordin</td></tr><tr><td>Our granddaughter requested The Odyssey and we felt this was the best choice as a gift for her.  We know the book was received, but have not gotten any further feed back at this time.</td></tr><tr><td>Look, it's quite simple. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, something's wrong with you. If you think this is a children's book, you're mistaken. If you think it's just another dime-a-dozen pulp fantasy novel for Dungeons & Dragons geeks, think again. This is a classic of English literature. Tolkien's world is so mind-bogglingly deep, rich, and vast that when you reach the end of the book, you might be startled to find yourself back in the \"real\" world. Tolkien's genius just sucks you in; his prose is utterly convincing. The characters become a part of you. His portrait of Middle Earth is one of the most vivid and lifelike ever put on paper. The language is sometimes dense, but it's so rewarding that it never feels difficult. The first time I read the books I think I completed each one in a single sitting. This is a book for everyone. It truly is mythic: there are the archetypes of Paradise, destiny and free will, Armageddon, the crusade of good against evil, and Man's place in the cosmos. You'll find yourself reading it time and time again. Invest in the hardcover edition, and pass it on to your grandkids.</td></tr><tr><td>I love Hemingway on Writing and A Moveable Feast as both have helped me become a better writer.  The Old Man and the Sea made a huge impression on me as a kid, and Hemingway has always struck me as the ideal writer.  This would be a perfect fit, right?  I don't know why, but I'm finding this book a little bit slow.  I'm still working on it, about 50% complete, and not feeling the urgency to pick it up that I like to feel with nonfiction.  No judgement until I'm done, but I can't help but feel like Hemingway the Writer might be great than Hemingway the writer...</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely loved this book as a child, in fact I still do! I can't wait to share it with my daughter, especially the poem \"Boing! Boing! Squeak!\".</td></tr><tr><td>Ice Hunt is another enjoyable over-the-top adventure with a tough guy hero, damsels in distress, and great bad guys.  The whole set-up is cardboard - but it's wonderful cardboard, ha ha.  The action comes fast and hard with one startling twist after another.  I keep thinking he can't possibly keep it, but he does, almost leaving you woozy at times. Once again Rollins saves his novel with innovations such as the lost Soviet ice station, cutting edge WMDs, and an even more spectacular secret that I won't spoil.  Much like Deep Fathom, Ice Hunt is most easily described as James Bond meets Indiana Jones and a barrel full of fun. Recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>I really wanted to like this last book but it was very predicable. It was a quick easy read. Loved that she finished it all in a lovely bow (no loose ends really).</td></tr><tr><td>Great product for price! Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>Colonel Protheroe had a lot of enemies, even his wife and daughter. His wife Anne was having an affair with Lawrence Redding. Lettice, his daughter couldn't stand her own father, and absolutely despised Anne as her stepparent. One the other hand there were others that did not like the Colonel as well, and wanted him dead. Mr. Stone, the archaeologist had some run-ins with the man as did Mr. Hawes. The Colonel was found shot in the back of the head in the Vicarage. At first, the police turn up eyebrows at Len Clements, the preacher, and his eccentric wife Griselda. Miss Jane Marple, a very wise old lady who does not miss anything at all, tries to piece the clues together and figure out the real killer here. The book is all about piecing these clues together until they find the real killer-which in the end is surprising. This is my first I've read of Christie. I don't know if I will try another one or not as this one bored me when it seemed all there was, was going over and over the details.</td></tr><tr><td>Wow! What a tragic story and courageous and very patient family. Casey has the ability to make the reader feel like you are there in the room, feeling all the emotions that comes with raising Justin. It opens up the difficulties kids have when having death with trauma and how it affects them for life. It also shows how sometimes the foster system doesn't always make the best choices, but with carers like the Watsons these kids have a brighter future. First foster child and first book, can't wait to read the others!</td></tr><tr><td>I was blown away by this book. Although it moved slow at first. It picked up speed and came to a  climax that blew my mind. I would read it again, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.</td></tr><tr><td>You do learn a fair amount of information from this book.  My main reasons for giving it only two stars are, first, often the book seems to belabor a point or a person.  Page after page are often devoted to one person while the point was made in the first couple pages.  I had wished the author would have moved on to other examples and not be so repetitive like I just was.  The whole first chapter is basically devoted to Ron Popiel (while a infomercial God, that's a lot) and I really don't care about his house too much or the houses other infomercial types own, I get it, many are rich.  Often topics simply go on for too many pages with no other examples, I wish more topics or examples had been covered.  Am I being repetitive? Second, the book almost seems to be written for insiders.  Its as if you are supposed to know who everyone in the industry is, where they live, what they sold and so on. The book really only covers a few topics/products in depth (Proactiv, real estate scams and medicinal cures), in my humble opinion, to the detriment of the ability to cover more information. You wonder if the review from Publisher Weekly above really read the book, The In-The-Shell Electric Egg Scrambler, Power Scissors, the Miracle Broom, etc. mentioned in the review are mentioned in the book basically in one line just as examples. There are some gems in this book and you may find it worthwhile, but be prepared to be saturated on some topics/people/scams.</td></tr><tr><td>The reader/reviewer from Acton, MA has it exactly right. This is a sloppily-written, plotless book, dripping with false-angst that makes the reader feel as if he or she had been mentally tortured to no purpose. Did Cornwell even submit this to an editor or was it sent directly to the printer? (The last is the only explanation for how it got into print in the first place.) How bad is it? The writing is so bad that Cornwell apparently thinks that `prepossessed by' is somehow synonymous with `absorbed by' or `consumed by,' and that it makes sense to write of something making one's psyche hurt. There is no plot, only a tedious unravelling of Kay Scarpetta's paranoid thoughts. The suspect isn't the suspect. The original crime isn't ever resolved (or even explained). The ending is simply an arbitrary farce, lacking surprise or suspense (and introducing minor characters who are brought onstage out of sheer desperation. Of course the main bad guys escape which makes me fear that Cornwell plans a sequel. I urge her to give up her plans and spare us. With the price of paperback `thrillers' edging up to ten dollars, readers deserve more from an author than typing. Don't waste your money.</td></tr><tr><td>If you enjoy this genre, check out the latest Alex Cross thriller.  Morgan Freeman returns to this role which is well-suited to his acting style.  He portrays the phlegmetic investigator who is still trying to recover from the death of his partner in a sting gone awry.  This time he matches wits with a man who enjoys toying with him.  The perpetrator kidnaps the daughter of a senator and hides her,with no immediate plans to demand ransom. Plots and counterplots, double-crosses and red herrings--these are all a part of this carefully planned and slickly executed movie.</td></tr><tr><td>I laughed out loud, smiled a lot, and cried a little.  A quick and easy read, but so worth every word! Wise and wonderful!</td></tr><tr><td>After reading Divergent, I had to go straight into Insurgent which was no disappointment.  I like this series, overall, more than The Hunger Games.  This love story is better & I like that it is not a triangle.</td></tr><tr><td>An excellent classic that I read for the first time.</td></tr><tr><td>This episode of the series has the most entertaining plot so far, however, I am beginning to tire of Snicket's defining of words within the story. Where at the beginning of the series, he appeared to be giving near-dictionary definitions, his adherence to this has deteriorated to where he is using the events of the book to define the word. For example: ...the words \"grotesque\" and \"unnerving\" here mean \"twisted, tangled, stained and gory.\" Which they do not, always.</td></tr><tr><td>Love this book and will make a great present!</td></tr><tr><td>satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>I saw the Lord of the Rings movies. There's a fair chance The Hobbit movie will be just as good. Since books are usually better than the movie, if the movie is good, the book is probably awesome. I highly recommend you read it, I don't have the time.</td></tr><tr><td>A shocking account, honestly and graphically written.  Amazing that anyone could survive something like this.  Very helpful for anyone else who may have gone through this sort of thing.  Thankfully, I didn't, but there is far too much of this and it must be told.</td></tr><tr><td>JUST AS DESCRIBED  AWESOME</td></tr><tr><td>This is another really good Jane Austen novel</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book many, many years ago.  Probably around the time it first came out.  I recentley re-read it mainly because I thought I remembered a fact that was brought up in the book and wanted to see if I remembered correctly. When I first read it, years ago, I did not particularly care for it.  However, I really enjoyed it this time .  Just goes to show that your taste can change over time, I guess.  It is not a long book and it moves pretty fast, and is quite interesting.  Although, I did keep wondering why none of these people ever whipped out their cell phones when things went bad.  Then I realized that when this book was written, everybody and their baby did not have cell phones like they do  now.  Having said that, I still felt that the story was great, and except for the absense of cells phones, the story felt very current.</td></tr><tr><td>After reading \"Casting The First Stone\" I had to read \"Too Much of a Good Thing\".  Both books were wonderful and I couldn't put it down!  Kimberla, you go gurl and keep on writing and I'll keep on reading!  This book is a must read, but read \"Casting the First Stone\" first.</td></tr><tr><td>Great copy of the book, good for anyone looking for a nostalgia trip or what have you.</td></tr><tr><td>.... and I mean that in a good way.  My Kindle has given me the opportunity to read books that have been long published and this is a good and bad thing - good thing is that once I start a series like The Wallflowers I don't have to wait for ages for the next book to be released.  Bad thing - it is costing me a fortune.  Just finished book 4 and I loved it - read some bad reviews and thought I would not like but but ignore them and read all the books.  Have actually a paper copy of Dreaming of You - bought it ages ago and never got round to reading it but it will be next (after I finish a Wallflower Christmas).  Matthew and Daisy's story was great - would highly recommend this book - in whatever format you read it.  It can be read as a stand alone but personally I love to catch up with all the characters from the previous books.  Loved all the heroes - OK Sebastian was the worst and maybe that is why most people liked him the best - we all love a villain!!  Hopefully Santa will give me Amazon gift vouchers for Christmas this year to keep me happy.</td></tr><tr><td>Better than book 3 almost as good as the first book</td></tr><tr><td>This book combines research and his own experience and life involvement with mindfulness. The book was informative and helpful. His arguments of the cruelty of some behavior techiques was compeling I highly recommend this book for those wishing to examine how you can better understand and control the anxiety and stress that washes over all of us.</td></tr><tr><td>Death and Judgment is a great read.. holds one 's interest from the get go. There is only one great ere in this book, it had already been written, and by Donna Leon.. yes a title change.. from: A Venetian Reckoning first published in 1995. Now a re relaese under this 'new' title in 2006. All things are in order, there is a statement about the new release, but nothing about the title change. To me this was mis leading.. stating a NEW book by Donna Leon is available.. But if one has not read A Venetian Reckoning.. this book should hold any mystery reader's interest.</td></tr><tr><td>Pretty engaging book, I enjoyed the story line and build up of characters. I am looking forward to the second book</td></tr><tr><td>Actually it's my seven year old grandson that is the one who loves it and it's the beginning of building his lifetime library.  His house will not only have books but shelves to house them.</td></tr><tr><td>Let's get it out of the way - this is not the best Pratchett book. It its well-written and funny, with the return of many great characters, and a few new somewhat interesting ones.  It's snappily paced.  It's witty. It also has a plot that isn't very fulfilling, some strange and optional loose ends, and a very annoying deus ex machina ending.  It feels like it's made of spare parts, no offense to the Igors. Essentially, Moist Von Lipwig, everyone's favorite postmortem postmaster, is bored.  The Patrician, of course knows this, and gives Moist a chance to do something else - running the Bank and Mint of Ankh-Morpork.  After all, Moist was used to stealing from banks, he just has to reverse his thinking. However, interested or not, events conspire to put Moist in charge, thanks to a series of events, a clever lady, and a dog.  Moist does love a challenge, and he rises to the occasion in some well-written and interesting looks at just what finance and money is. But despite the best efforts, there's not much plot here, there's not much going on.  There's sort of an antagonist, but not much of one.  There's some interesting characters introduced that aren't realized quite as fully as they could be.  It's really a plot beneath anyone of Pratchett's caliber - it is his talent that keeps it from being a total mess to one that's not fulfilling. My take is the book is meant to bridge onward to the next novels, as I feel Pratchett is building up towards some big changes in his world.  But it's a rickety bridge, even if the company is pleasant.  I'd give it 2 stars, but some of the writing and characterization, plus some twists that set things up for the future, are interesting.</td></tr><tr><td>The Flashman books are unabashedly politically incorrect, often hilarious, remarkably accurate historical novels - set in the 19th Century. Our hero - Harry Flashman, an officer in the British military - is a self-admitted scoundrel/rascal/cad/rogue - \"his personal character was deplorable, his conduct abandoned, and his talent for mischief apparently inexhaustible.\" - and because of his \"self-awareness\" is very likeable. Harry is usually on the run from someone - the law, a jealous husband or some figure of authority - and during his travels meets up with historical figures and stumbles into historical events - usually of the military nature - inadvertently fighting the \"good fight\". And as can be surmised, Harry is never short of female companionship. The stories are told from the fictional \"Flashman Papers\", written by Harry in his twilight years, \"edited\" by the author - including \"footnotes\" which I encourage you to read - and which were \"discovered\" in 1966 - The \"faux\" authenticity only adding to the enjoyment in reading these books. In this volume, a two-parter which chronicles Harry's adventures in 1849-50 and 1875-76, we find our hero in the U.S., mostly in the Wild West, with a few sojourns in New York and Washington, DC. As the title suggests, \"Flashy\" encounters and becomes embroiled in the Native American \"problem\". In the first half of the book he leads a wagon train - actually a bordello on the move - from New Orleans to the west coast. In the second half Harry is enlisted - by President Grant - to aid in the \"negotiations\" with the Sioux Nation - the story climaxing with Custer's Last Stand. In the telling of the story the reader meets a cornucopia of historical figures - U.S. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Crazy Horse, Spotted Tail, Mangas Coloradas, Kit Carson, Wild Bill Hickok and of course Custer - just to name a few. And Flashman - true to form - is not only in the midst of the all the action - he's the root cause in some instances - and of course he has more than a few romantic liaisons along the way. If historical novels, with more than a little humor, are your cup of tea, this volume and the Flashman series will suit you perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>The plot/story-line in Foreign Country is a well-worn one in \"espionage fiction\". A disgraced spy, wallowing in private life, is called back in for a job for which he/she is uniquely qualified - the first requirement being our unlikely hero is expendable. Add in a long hidden secret now exposed through a nefarious blackmail plot, mysterious disappearances and identities, a double murder and some international travel  - all framed and constrained by the bureaucracy of MI6 - and one would be excused for shrugging, \"Been there. Done that.\", and passing on this book - which would be a mistake. This is a neat, tidy, fun, engaging, well-written spy thriller, albeit a thriller in the John Le Carre sense, not in the mindless Vince Flynn/Joseph Finder sense. Nor is it stale as the Daniel Silva/Gabriel Allon series has become. There are some \"split second\" moments with car chases and gunfire, but mostly - just like Cummings' previous books - there are well thought out plans and plots, as well as a cast of both likeable and believable characters. If you are looking for a fun summer/beach read - look no further. You'll enjoy A Foreign Country.</td></tr><tr><td>Blood and Bone is a stand-alone thriller and a departure for this author from his very good Victor Carl series. Our hero, Kyle Byrne, is a 26 year-old ne'er do well and a quintessential under-achiever. Think of a California beach bum residing in Philadelphia. Kyle is also the illegitimate son of a somewhat well known attorney - who died suddenly when Kyle was 12. As the book opens his dad's ex-law-partner is murdered and Kyle finds himself awash in fleeting memories of his father, unresolved paternal issues and on the periphery of the attention of the police. Attempting to find some answers, Kyle becomes embroiled in the murder case - which becomes more and more complicated as he and the police work to solve the crime. The core plot of this book is pretty good, i.e. Kyle' search for the truth about his father and where that journey takes him. Unfortunately the telling of this tale falls far short of this author's previous works. Rather than letting his cast of characters develop the story for the reader, the author jumps in and explains things, including Kyle's new found assertiveness and can-do attitude, as well as the book's plot and twists - I guess in case the reader doesn't follow them.  \"Suspense\" is built up by dragging scenes out page after page, including the conclusion, which goes on for 60 or so pages - which simply deflates any and all tension or excitement. This is just a guess, but this book reads as if it was written a while ago, mothballed, pulled back out of a drawer for whatever reason, and halfheartedly edited and updated for publication. And although I recommend passing on this one, don't judge the author by this book. As stated previously, Lashner's Victor Carl series is very good.</td></tr><tr><td>great book and writing</td></tr><tr><td>good for teaching English</td></tr><tr><td>The description of the book store was the best part of this novel, and the book got off to a fairly good start. Ultimately, however, it was disappointing in terms of both plot and the characters. Rosemary seemed incomplete--not just in terms of being young. Yes, she, nearly alone, does survive to tell the tale--but she never seems to fully realize the amount of damage that she caused. The \"secret\" of lost things seems to have escaped her The language is often beautiful, but in several instances the word choice is jarringly off.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved, learned and lusted while reading this book.  It was a sensual journey into nature and the lives of unusual characters.  I learned about moths, predators and prey, and more. When I finished, I wanted to go out and plant a garden to get my hands dirty.  While reading this book, I could smell spring, feel the sweat running down my back after hard work outside, appreciate nature in a new way. . . all while sitting in my living room.</td></tr><tr><td>A very worthwhile read even though it is not among the best of the series.  As the main characters grow older over time in the series, their parts in the story still have strong appeal.  I am looking forward to the continuation of the story in future Bernard Cornwell books.</td></tr><tr><td>A bit more lighthearted than Mr. Cornwell`s usual fare, and thoroughly entertaining. 1356 is well worth reading. As usual the historical research is outstanding, leading the reader to \"feel\" as though he/she is right there amidst all the action. The battle scenes are as exciting as any of Mr. Cornwell`s other works of historical fiction. I highly recommend 1356 to any fan of the genre.</td></tr><tr><td>The music is great.  The recording is not.  It's a good album to listen to on the boom box.  If you have an above avarage system because your an audiophile, you won't be playing this more than once on the \"big\" system.</td></tr><tr><td>When I started this book did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised as I got further into the story. It is a story of trials, heartache, pain,  and lots of different emotions from both sides and the miracle that took place and helped heal a family. I am glad I decided to read this book and if you like animals and how they play a big part in our lives think you will enjoy this story.</td></tr><tr><td>This is simply my favorite book.  Written in the late 50s it's completely prophetic to the 2010s.  Recently cited in a .gov study on utopian/dystopian approaches to psycho-pharmaceuticals in literature, this book is far more. It's an antidote to the philosophy and literature of Ayn Rand. It shows a possible better way, utopian even, of living, but also is clear of what can happen when energy companies and tyrants have the upper hand.  It will have you experiencing a wonderful reality and making you think, could we really create this kind of world?</td></tr><tr><td>Canada is a novel that most can identify with. It deals with the common word family dysfunction. A family is normal as long as the father has a job in the Air Force. When he leaves all kinds of schemes are followed to make a living, theft, and  ultimately bank robbery. The book sadly tells the tale of a young son and escaped sister who deal painfully with the loss of their parents. There is somewhat of a happy ending, mainly the son following a career and marriage. A great story for our time</td></tr><tr><td>We were missing this Eric Carle book.  We have many.  I got this book for my 18 month old. The illustrations are great and the prose is just right.  This is one that we all enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>Love this whole series!  Lynsay Sands is Awesome</td></tr><tr><td>Love this book! It has not only helped me effectively communicate with my children but also with my friends and family.</td></tr><tr><td>Jess Aarons, who wants to be the fastest boy in the 5th grade and doesn't get along very well with his family, befriends the new girl at school, Leslie Burke.  Among his schoolmates, only Leslie appreciates Jess's artistic temperament, and the two soul mates become inseperable, spending long hours together and creating their own imaginary kingdom--until tragedy strikes unexpectedly. Katherine Paterson's novel, simply but effectively written, provides an opportunity to consider and discuss issues such as the nature of friendship, the meaning of death, and the importance of acceptance.  I thought Paterson stumbled at one point by having a teacher act in an unprofessional, implausible manner, but the resulting development was so powerful that my objection was soon forgotten.</td></tr><tr><td>To a new series that takes us on a journey filled with adventure, many twists and a few chills.  I knew from the second I pre-ordered this book that it was 1 book in a collection of I believe it was 14 total books; so I didn't expect the entire tale to be finished and wrapped up in red ribbons at the end of book #1.  I expected the usual cliffhanger ending leading to books 2, 3, 4 etc.  What I got was a book that while yes it left ample room for more down the road, it was in and of itself a satisfying complete tale that could easily be read as a stand alone; although I'm looking forward to more adventures. I see some have had a problem with the depiction of women being dark and evil in this series.  I myself do not.  I was raised at a time when witches were dark and evil and yes most of them portrayed in books, movies, television shows etc were women.  I think it balances a bit in that while it was never stated, I got the impression that boggarts are male and they have their own mischief, malice and darkness associated with them. I would recommend this book to both YA audiences and to those who just like a good tale they may hear in the dark of night, seated around a campfire when any and everything is possible...</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent book that makes a very compelling case about what needs to be done in order for small businesses to succeed. Basically, it states that you should emulate the franchise model where systems manage the business and people manage the systems (it is a mistake to have people manage the business without systems). The book also makes an insightful observation: your product is not what you sell (that is a commodity), but the business itself.</td></tr><tr><td>Clarke is really knowledgeable about science having predicted the use of orbiting satellites for communication.  The book was written in 1960's, predicting what may be in the future and although most predictions have not come to pass, some have!  Very interesting read.</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot describe how much I loved this book.  I have read it late into the night, over my lunch hour, to and from work, just to finish it. I used to live in Holland and the evocation of the Netherlands and 17th century Dutch life is marvellous.  But what is truly wonderful is the 20th century voice of Griet, the maidservant, who evolves and matures under the watchful eye of her master, the great painter Vermeer.  You read this book with your heart in your mouth, greedy for the next page, and to find out how the story of these fascinating characters will end.  This story of the maidservant and the painter is not formulaic, Vermeer does not seduce Griet on page 1, and it is not predictable.  This story is far, far more complex and interesting, and sensual, as a result. I am so sad this book had to come to an end.  Read it, you will love it.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book. I will looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series. I enjoyed this part of the story.</td></tr><tr><td>The Wide Window is another funny story with a lot of action and great use of humor.  My 7 year-old daughter really enjoyed having it read to her and is looking forward to reading the fourth book.</td></tr><tr><td>Real page turner. Very good </td></tr><tr><td>daughter loves this book</td></tr><tr><td>The descendants of the legendary tycoon, Emma Harte continues where Emma stopped. Her granddaughter, Paula feels the need to prove herself beyond just managing what Emma had built and later finds that jealous and revengeful members of the family are laying in wait to take advantage of any miss steps she might make. Bradford gives us an intriguing epic story of love, treachery and heartbreak, which makes for an exciting and heart warming page-turner</td></tr><tr><td>I very much enjoyed Andrew Taylor's The Anatomy of Ghosts and was looking forward to this one.  It is not as good, but is still an enjoyable read. Set in New York in 1779-79 during the War of Independence, the plot concerns Edward Savill, an English civil servant sent from London to deal with claims by Loyalists who have lost property during the fighting.  Narrated in the first person by Savill the story develops into a mystery and an adventure in which he and his acquaintances become embroiled and endangered.  I won't give away any plot  I wouldn't have wanted to know more than that before I started  but it is a period mystery/thriller which began well, dragged somewhat and then picked up for the last two hundred pages or so. Taylor creates a very good sense of place and of period.  The privations of a freezing winter are especially well done and I thought this a real strength of the book.  His prose is easy to read and preserves a good sense of the language of the time while not sticking rigidly to it: a difficult balance which he pulls off very well.  The plot unfolds at a leisurely pace, and while this can be very effective, I did feel that there wasn't quite enough real content to carry the book for quite long periods in the central section and I thought it could do with being a good deal shorter. Nevertheless, I think this is a generally involving and enjoyable book, and I recommend it, especially if you like historical fiction.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is clearly written with a sense of humor and many perceptive insights into body language and facial expressions. The author's many years as an FBI agent, with a psychology background, give it a persuasive professional tone but its intended audience is laymen. Particularly interesting are the many annecdotes Mr. Navarro includes throughout his narrative.</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful and compelling.</td></tr><tr><td>Fascinating.  Highly recommended!!  The lives of 4 girls who worked for a sugar company in England.  The history of the time - just after World War Two - was riveting.  Each girl was unique and each life interesting.  Great non- fiction.  Other excellent fiction and non- fiction writers during World War One and Two and after are - William Jarvis, Judith Lennox, Margaret Mayhew, Melynda Jarrett, Vera F. Cracknell Long, Eileen Townsend, Pamela Winfield, Soraya Lane, Anne DeCourcy, and Iris Jones Simantel.  I enjoyed GI Brides also written by Duncan Barrett.  A++++++</td></tr><tr><td>This is an outstanding book.  I hope and pray lots of people read this memoir.  The book is a reflection and is a soul searching journey.  I just finished Bill O'Reilly's new book \"Old School\" which discusses many of the same issues.  J. D. Vance's book discusses his family, addictions, love for his grandmother, schools, decisions, car wrecks, the Marines, fights, Kentucky, Ohio, Yale, Iraq, and more.  This is a must read and deserves an A++++++</td></tr><tr><td>Full Disclosure - I am a BIG fan of Neal Stephenson. So big, that I had to be honest about this book and NOT give it the fifth star due to The Halo Effect. NS takes a \"what if\" and proceeds from there, as in, \"What if the Moon suddenly blows up?\". Thus the first two-thirds of the book, where humankind has two years to deal with the end of the world. As usual, NS delves right into the Big Questions. And then gives the Big Answers. As usual, NS goes into intricate detail about many technical things, such as orbital mechanics. After reading this book, you will be able to pilot a craft from Earth to anywhere. Neal loves going into intricate detail about many technical things, as readers of his other books know all too well. Not everyone wants to read about thrusters and radiation sickness for many  pages at a time though, so if you aren't a tech person, be warned. Then it's FIVE THOUSAND YEARS LATER! Again many descriptions of technical things, such as a wearable flight glider, and a habitat ring, and rotating things, etc. Oh, and surprise, there have been wars. Why no fifth star? As noted, the character development needed work. And the future part feels strained and rushed. And the end seemed to come right at the attainment of a certain word count. Of course, many loose ends are left for a possible sequel. The most important reason for no fifth star is that this book did NOT affect me like Anathem did, where the Big Questions get answered to the point that really got me thinking. Even more than the end of a Stephenson novel. But the book is worth its four stars. If you are a Stephenson fan, you will enjoy all the tech. So definitely read it.</td></tr><tr><td>This book makes a classic gift for the philosopher in the family-I would also recommend FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz-soon to be a new classic!</td></tr><tr><td>This truly is a classic tale of social insight, a story of one seeking acceptance and desiring companionship but being rejected and branded a monster. The thing that I liked most about this book is the fact that it's divided into two accounts, designed to view both sides of the story. The first part of the book `Frankenstein' tells the story of the life of Victor Frankenstein, the creation of Monster Frankenstein and the death of his younger brother William. A servant `Justine' has been put on trial for this murder, but Victor knows the identity of the true killer. Monster Frankenstein and Victor finally meet up and despite his desire to kill his creation, Victor is forced to listen to the monster's story, after being threatened. `The Modern Prometheus' tells the story of the Monster Frankenstein, confused and unsure from the very first day of life, found himself hiding in the woods watching people and learning how to find food, create a fire and how to differentiate between the feelings of happiness and sadness. Watching a family in poverty taught Monster Frankenstein many things and he started chopping wood and shoveling snow for the family while they slept. His loneliness finally drove him to show himself to this family who ended up running away in fear. With a mixture of loneliness and anger, he seeks out his creator, finding his way to William where he decides to kidnap him for companionship and ends up accidentally strangling him. This is where the two stories meet and monster Frankenstein pleads with Victor saying he's `a good creature turned bad by unforgiving humans who scoffed at friendship'. The monster pleads with Victor to make him a companion which he would take and never be heard from again. Victor reluctantly agrees but found it harder and harder to do, even though his family was in danger. Victor began to realize the female companion could wreck much havoc by giving birth to more monsters and refusing to be with the monster as a mate altogether. Monster Frankenstein swears revenge and goes about killing everyone close to Victor in attempt to show Victor what it feels like to be alone. As Frankenstein dies, the monster appears in his room and begs his dead body for forgiveness. In the end the story has no true villain or hero. Monster Frankenstein and Victor Frankenstein were both portrayed as hero and villain. The story also leaves you wondering on how you treat others, do our actions end up turning people into a `monsters'? Overall this was a brilliant story, although the language was at times hard to understand, it is still worth the read.</td></tr><tr><td>Lawrence Block is one of our most talented mystery authors. In the Bernie Rhodenbarr series he explores out an ordinary, but intelligent, \"honest\" person might go about pursuing a life of crime as a fastidious and talented burglar who isn't proud of what he does, doesn't like to hang out with criminals, and really gets a big thrill out of breaking and entering . . . and removing valuables. As you can see, there's a sitcom set-up to provide lots of humor. But the humor works well in part because Mr. Block is able to put the reader in the Bernie's shoes while he breaks, enters and steals . . . and evades the long arm of the law. To balance the \"honest\" burglar is an array of \"dishonest\" and equally easy-money loving cops. As a result, you're in a funny moral never-never land while your stomach tightens and your arm muscles twitch as tension builds. To make matters even more topsy-turvy, Bernie at some point in every story turns into an investigator who must figure out \"who-dun-it\" for some crime that he personally didn't do. It's almost like one of those \"mystery at home\" games where the victim comes back as the police investigator, playing two roles. Very nice! So much for explaining the concept of the series. The Burglar in the Closet is the second book in the series. I strongly suggest that you begin the series by reading Burglars Can't Be Choosers. Each story in the series adds information and characters in a way that will reduce your pleasure of the others if read out of order. Although, I originally read them out of order and liked them well enough. I'm rereading them now in order, and like it much better this way. The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling comes next in the series. As Stephen King likes to point out, a great way to start a book is to put a character in an unusual situation and then let things happen from there. The Burglar in the Closet certainly follows that route in a successful manner with what reads and feels like a very realistic (and hilarious to think about) burglary experience. The complications soon start coming from all directions like sharpened spears, and Bernie's ducking before one of them hits him! Along the way you'll meet The World's Greatest Dentist and his hygienist, some remarkably vivid barflies, and visit again with the brilliant, but bent cop, Ray Kirschmann from Burglars Can't Be Choosers. Bernie gets accused of just about everything but what he actually did, and as before, straightens matters out through his own investigation. I thought that the identity of the more serious criminal was pretty obvious, but the plot develops in such a witty, charming way that I didn't really mind. The plot is pretty complicated, and will keeep you on your toes . . . so pay attention! This book is definitely a step up from Burglars Can't Be Choosers and really establishes the series as a solid one for fans of off-beat mysteries. As I read this book, I was reminded of Murphy's Law (anything that can go wrong, will). Most of the unpleasant situations in our lives come about because we ignore Mr. Murphy. This book will certainly remind you to think through what could go wrong . . . before you go ahead. Donald Mitchell Co-author of The 2,000 Percent Solution, The Irresistible Growth Enterprise and The Ultimate Competitive Advantage</td></tr><tr><td>Reading this book made me feel like I was 17 again.  Around my high school graduation, I experienced several nights like the one described in I Love You, Beth Cooper.  The book had me laughing so hard that my wife and daughter kept interrupting their reading of the new Harry Potter book to find out what was so funny.  This book is an instant comic classic! In Denis Cooverman's high school, seating was often alphabetical.  That placed him in the seat behind head cheerleader, Beth Cooper, for many classes over the years.  His admiration grew while she had no awareness of him. Their worlds are far apart.  He's the class valedictorian and ace debater who plans to become a physician.  She doesn't do so well in school, will be attending the local college, and works at Payless Shoes for 35 hours a week. But that distance is bridged when Denis interrupts his valedictory speech to say, \"I love you, Beth Cooper.\"  She speaks to him and that leads to the kind of madcap night that creates a wonderful coming of age story. Complications occur immediately when Beth's boyfriend is offended by Denis's declaration.  That jealousy sets up a conflict that allows both Beth and Denis to get to know themselves better. The evening is physically challenging for Denis.  You'll keep up by looking at his face through a series of drawings done in the style of the cover drawing.  These drawings make the book much more visceral than it would otherwise be. The larger theme of the book is about facing up to your own situation and doing something about it.  Denis's speech has an influence on Beth and her boyfriend, Kevin, but you'll find that others are moved, too. Denis's friend, Rich, provides much comic relief for Denis's angst during the night.  If you like old movies, you'll enjoy his continual references to them.  Nostalgia is also fired by the many references to old songs. I have one regret:  I wish that Kevin and his friends had been part of a motorcycle gang rather than in the Army.  That change would have made the humor work better.</td></tr><tr><td>I should count up how many books on abuse childhoods I have read whether purchased from Amazon or another site. I will start out my review by saying I really was disappointed this took place in England as did the vast majority of child-abuse memoirs I have read. I live in America, and have yet to read a book about a case that took place here although I know child abuse is as rampant in the US. as anywhere in the world. Joe's world was all right as long as he had his father William to protect him from his mother. Then came a day when a thoughtless customer caused a fire at a gas station that fatally burned his father who died in a hospital. From then until he was able to escape, he was at the mercy of Lesley, his mother. Page by page you get to thinking how this can be possible, but with countless books about severe child abuse, I never doubted it. It got worse when a pedophile turned Joe into a sex toy which became much worse when his friends took their turns on a defenseless boy for their perverted desires. What is so often the case is when authorities were alerted Joe's mom turned on the charms and made them believe she was a good mother and Joe was a troublesome juvenile. You scratch your heads at the attitude of police and doctors and wonder why anyone cannot see Joe as the victim of torture? In the end, Joe not only broke away from his mother and her friends, he found a wife and raised five children, striving to be the kind of dad his dad was and to be the loving, nurturing parent his mother was not. I will have to read his other book for the continuation of a horrific journey with a happy ending. Kudos Joe for being willing to bring your story to light, but very sad you are among too many children with no happy memories of childhood.</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this book to use with my presentations on composting with worms to elementary students.  It's an entertaining way to reinforce interesting facts about worms. The humor will delight both the kids and adults and the illustrations are great.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good wordlists in the back of the book to teach kids how to read and write in English.</td></tr><tr><td>HARD TO BELIEVE ALL THESE YEARS TALKING ABOUT IT ETC NEVER READ IT. IT IS CLASSIC ANTI WAR BOOK  A BIT TOO SOMBER BUT IT SPEAKS STILL TODAY. IF YOU ARE MY AGE BORN 1940 AND HAVNT READ IT TAKETHE TIME AND DO IT</td></tr><tr><td>Leonie Frieda has written a tremendous biography of a much maligned Renaissance queen. Catherine De Medici has been blamed for many of the ills experienced by France after the death of her husband, Henry II. How much complicity she had in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre is still a subject of debate. Leonie Frieda states that she did have some culpability. However, she also makes it clear that Catherine made many efforts to make peace with the Huguenots before and after the event. Something that history seems to have neglected. Catherine's entire reign has been defined by that one event. There was much more to this remarkable renaissance queen. She was a woman of her times and ahead of her time. She received an education far beyond what was considered respectable for a woman. She cultivated the arts, poetry and architecture. And yet, she is considered the \"Queen of poisons\" because several of her enemies seemed to conveniently die (of poison ?). Above all, she was a mother to her children. What is interesting about her is that while she was never affectionate with her children, she loved and protected them. She made sure all of them married well. That was important during the Renaissance. A woman was defined by her marriage. Catherine was no different. Most of her early life was defined by her marriage to Henry II. She didn't come into her own until after his death when she became regent for her son, Francis. This is a period when she flourished. Up until that point, she remained the dutiful and submissive queen. She may well have owed that position to Diane De Poiters, Henry IIs mistress. Catherine remained childless for the first nine years of her marriage. That would have been a legitimate legal reason for an annulment. With Diane's urging (?), Henry kept Catherine and they eventually went on to have ten children. Catherine's relationship with her sons makes for absorbing reading. Three sons lived to become king of France and in Henry III's case, Poland. Her daughters did not achieve the same success of their mother. Although, Margot achieved equal notoriety. This is a wonderful biography as well as history of Renaissance France. I highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>Granddaughter just loves it!! What a wonderful way to start out what will be a long life of reading!!! Great !!</td></tr><tr><td>I totally agree with Thomas Paine. This book has opened my eyes. From now on I consider myself Deism.  Thomas Paine was before his time.</td></tr><tr><td>This book will make you laugh out loud, guaranteed.  It's a marvelous blend of social satire and great character development that upon completion will likely lead you to rush out and buy everything else Christopher Moore has written.  I do have a caveat, however:  It's not safe to lend his books!  Your friends will love them so much, they'll lend to their friends, and so on.....and you'll never see them again. I'm on my second or third copy of most of his books, you'd think I'd know better by now!  And I want them in my library because they are amazingly funny and poignant on subsequent readings too!</td></tr><tr><td>HAVE YOU FOGOTTEN HOW IT FEELS TO BE AN ADOLESCENT?  THIS WILL REMIND YOU OF THE PAIN AND THE JOY !</td></tr><tr><td>I love Barbara Kingsolver but found this book a little tough to get into in the beginning chapters. By the time the book involved Diego and Frida and their link with Trotsky, I was hooked. I love the way BK tells truths in so many different ways- looking at situations with different eyes. So glad I read this.</td></tr><tr><td>This may be picky, I believe too much of an expansion of thought in the sayings of the wise diminishes the impact on the individual. My father used to say that \"wisdom is having a lot to say on a subject and not saying it\". The wise leave their sayings vague on purpose to allow the reader to discover themselves in the verses.  This version attempts to make the transition in languages clear and destroys the ability to discover one's self.</td></tr><tr><td>Again I purchased this book for my granddaugher's second birthday. She loves being read to and I thought this will be a book to read over and over.</td></tr><tr><td>A hard boiled homicide detective, beaten by the world, finds himself awoken, bottle in hand, by the manager of the flea bag motel where he now finds himself in residence. Another resident, a junkie, has been murdered, bullet to the back of the head, assassination style. Likely this set up sounds familiar, the opening to countless novels penned by Mickey Spillane/Raymond Chandler wannabes. Not so for Michael Chabon's gripping \"Yiddish Policeman's Union\" for this detective, Meyer Landsman works the mean streets not of New York or Chicago or Los Angeles but the Sitka Alaska Federal District, home to 3 million Jews given temporary refuge in 1939 from the growing maelstrom of Hitler's Europe. Chabon's novel weaves such a creative and tight web one hardly knows where to begin. With the author's well researched alternative history where the Jewish State of Israel fails still born in 1948 and the so-called \"Frozen Chosen\" build a home in the far north? With his cleverly imagined Yiddish slang and the fully realized city of Sitka, offered to the reader in such detail that one can smell the cheese on the blintzes in the cafeteria where Landsman often dines, see the snow on those dark cold streets, remember the short lived excitement of Sitka's hosting the '77 World's Fair, and taste the famous cherry pie served by the non-Jewish couple in Sitka's airport? Or, perhaps, this being a work by Michael Chabon, a reviewer should dwell on the themes of alienation, identity, and redemption which form the current that runs through all of that excellent author's work? Any of these would be worthy topics to consider and I could wax poetics regarding the \"Yiddish Policeman's Union's\" success with each. Yet spending too much time on any of these might detract from the pleasure readers are sure to find in this wonderful novel. As with Chabon's previous work, the perfectly sculpted sentences, laden with pathos and a sly wit, will surely give readers pause. Likewise will you come to feel you know his characters as though old acquaintance, such as Berko, Landsman's cousin and partner, a half Indian orthodox Jewish bear of a cop, with his two children and a third on the way. For all of these reasons, any reader will find much to delight in this excellent novel, perhaps Chabon's best to date. With skill and humor, he has elevated the noir genre, paid homage to the likes of Raymond Chandler, and given you a gift that you will surely treasure.</td></tr><tr><td>Love this play! It's hilarious. XD</td></tr><tr><td>I love it . I love the way I can touch and find so much info just by the symbols next to the words. great for kindle.</td></tr><tr><td>After years of psychotherapy and countless medication changes I found it a losing battle that seemed to have no end. My psychiatrist had moved out of town and I was assigned a new psychiatrist. At our first meeting she suggested I sounded like I had OCD. Being that everyone claims to have OCD I was initially thinking \"oh great another meaningless diagnosis\". She then referred me to a specialist that treats OCD. The specialist recommended this book to me along with the OCD Workbook. As soon as I opened this book up I saw that 99% of my problem was in-fact OCD. I have what is called \"Pure-O\". It means that all of the compulsions and obsessions go on in my head. I don't need to constantly touch things or do rituals other than ones I do in my head like saying repeated mantras. This simple fact freed me from many of my outlandish obsessions almost immediately! The more subtle ones, however do persist. Realizing that OCD is a physiological and not just a psychological disorder is also empowering. This book gives 4 simple to understand and perform new rituals that in time actually rewire the brain to some extent. I may never be totally free from OCD, but I will be able to better manage its ravaging nature, and to me makes this one of the best books I have ever read.</td></tr><tr><td>A favorite classic -- but the e-book is also well done, complete with period illustrations. A great addition to the Kindle Library.</td></tr><tr><td>This book just couldn't hold my interest. I would find my mind wandering and would realize I had no idea what I had just read. It was very confusing and disjointed. There would be an interesting part and then I would find myself confused, wondering where the author had gone. I couldn't wait to finish it.</td></tr><tr><td>If you're a good parent you won't want your kids to read these books.  I heard good things about them, so I read the first two books myself.  These are sick books.  There is little character development and the plot is ridiculously repetitive and redundant. Worse, the books contain graphic, gory details about murder, dead bodies, the color of dead bodies, using a syringe to poke a hole in someone and kill them, breaking glass to slit someone, kidnapping, polygamy (yes the actual word is even defined in this series.) If you are an adult or teenager you need to get a life and read something more worthwhile.  If you are a parent looking at these books for your pre-teen or younger children, please do not buy these.  Our children need good examples of moral behavior in their reading.  They don't need gruesome specifics about murder, dead murdered bodies, how to kill people, and all other sorts of evil and darkness.</td></tr><tr><td>Just ok</td></tr><tr><td>Very good couldn't put it down !!</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent product!</td></tr><tr><td>A good beach story makes every summer better, and this one fits that bill, if you are simply interested in a valueless fiction novel. Bockoven's ambiguous morality and confused spiritual concepts will spin your head like a top. One couple commits what their Catholic upbringing labels \"mortal\" or unforgivable sin,  yet they somehow end up together in a heaven they don't believe in. Um. No. For those who care, there are explicit sex scenes and foul language. As part of the mixed spiritual messages, Jesus is a swear word and the pastor of a Christian church gets the support of his congregation when he decides to divorce his wife because she's \"BORING\".</td></tr><tr><td>I guess after the \"Game of Thrones\" series I had high expectations.  This was on OK read but definitely not up to those standards. Too much time spent on different houses and lords of houses and cousins or brothers or sisters of houses.</td></tr><tr><td>Me likey</td></tr><tr><td>This is an awesome dystopian series! Can't wait for the next book to come out! Great easy read. Its just amazing where it takes you mentally! I would recommend to anyone that enjoyed the series: Matched, The Hunger Games or Delirium!</td></tr><tr><td>What a great tale Veronica Roth has written!  Her ability to create this world in which her characters live puts you right in that world, experiencing what they are experiencing, with just the right amount of excitement, mystery, romance, and adventure.  I cannot wait to read the two books that follow this one!</td></tr><tr><td>Really loved this series.  I have over 28 books plus.  Stephanie Laurens is a wonderful writer.</td></tr><tr><td>The characters are good, but this book was a bit of a let down. The forest went bad? How about a little explanation? I'll read the next one, going for resolution.</td></tr><tr><td>Jeffrey Archer can do no wrong.....well of course he went to jail for perjury, but that does not diminish his writings.  I love everything he writes.  His novels are spare but fast paced with great plots.  So are his short stories  As short stories go, there is always a twist at the end, so it is best to just read them one at a time so as not to become jaded.</td></tr><tr><td>His pros is great. The story just isn't fleshed out. It's supposed to take place over about a year and it feels like a week. Moreover, the ending just isn't compelling enough to want to continue. Protagonist is interesting, though.</td></tr><tr><td>A good book and is at the level (3) that it says it is.  My 6 year old learned some new words and got some confidence from reading it.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was beautiful and heartwarming and gave me so many feels. The characters were all fantastic especially Charlotte, whom I love so dearly. The writing was full of imagery and very powerful. Would I read more by this author? Yes yes yes. Would I recommend this to others? Yes yes yes yes yes. See the full review on my blog, Awesome Book Assessment: http://www.awesomebookassessment.com/2014/12/charlottes-web-by-e-b-white.html</td></tr><tr><td>I wish I had time to do this book justice. I am a die-hard liberal, and thus biased by Yuval's liberal take on things. That said, he is a cognitive psychologist, a sociologist, and anthropologist, a historian and a scholar. Like me, he is a brilliant philosopher and thinker. He moves from recent discoveries about early Homo Sapiens (and Home Neandarthalensis and Homo Erectus and such) to modern times. He convincingly argues that man of 45,000 years ago was no less intelligent than man of today, and that he was better off. He then discusses what is needed for humans to advance (which does not mean to become better off, but only to become more powerful and advanced): Agreed upon fiction (anything that exists only in the minds of humans and ceases to exist when humans stop imagining it to be real). This can take the form of currency, religion or empire. I would love to go further, but I am sleepy. I may amend this when I finish the book. I am 3/4 through it now, but Herbert Hoover and Petronius are slowing me down.</td></tr><tr><td>Christopher Moore's books are a treat you should definitely indulge in if you haven't already.  It appeals to all ages teen and above.  I actually purchased my son a copy of this book (my husband and I had already read it) because it was a summer reading choice for my son's English class.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this as a gift.  I thought it would appeal to a boy, but I find my husband and I enjoyed it more than we think the younger set would.  There is some basic skill coverage in the book, but also some parts that are far more meaningful to someone who has lived a bit more life than the typical young boy.  It makes a great coffee table book.  My boys are older, and reach for it when they have some time to kill.</td></tr><tr><td>It was fabulous. Very fast shipment</td></tr><tr><td>I adore this series!! Stephanie Laurens is a master at the Alpha Rake!! I love the men pursuing their ladies!! What a great story! I laughed and cried many times! Such wonderful writing and really engaging characters!! I love this authors work!! I adore this whole series and can not wait to see each man get his lady. It is a bit formula with the alpha male who is often chased finding a lady he wants and being forced to pursue her. But formula works that why we love it! Each book has an add but of intrigue that draws you in. And Stephanie Laurens knows how to deliver the steam!! I am currently on a Regency kick and this one was terrific!!</td></tr><tr><td>Highly entertaining and well written. I had a great time reading this one.  I can't wait for the next book in this series!!!</td></tr><tr><td>I am a big fan of the books by Mercer Mayer. They are simple, but always have a nice message. Most books have a little spider, cricket, and/or mouse to find on each page to make the book even more fun.</td></tr><tr><td>Son needed for book report</td></tr><tr><td>This book is my standard:  the book by which all other books are compared.  You feel as if you've gone to the Congo and could describe it to someone as if you've lived there.  And the characters. . . be ready to see someone in the street with light blond hair and think \"she has hair like Rachel's\".  When you finish the book, it will be as if you're leaving your friends behind.  I've never read a book with such great character development!  Buy 2 copies of this book:  one to keep and re-read and one to lend out (hoping that you'll get it back again).</td></tr><tr><td>Everybody wants to read CORALINE. And why do they? Because the story is absolutely wonderful. CORALINE has a magical and whimsical quality that makes it absolutely scrumptious. I love the way that I was able to pick up this book, be finished reading it in an hour, and feel absolutely satisfied afterwards. Although this is a book written with children in mind, it is quite enjoyable for adults. I think that the allure of children's books is that they take you to a world outside of the hum-drum of everyday life. While CORALINE is a little on the scarey and weird side, it definitely does take you to a strange world behind a curious door in Coraline's new house. At first, everything behind the door seems to be a mirror of the life on the other side of the door. However, there are just a few changes that tempt her to stay in the other world rather than in her own. For example, in the other world, her other mother can actually cook a decent meal. Her other room is painted beautiful colors and her other toys seem to be alive. Of course, it was too good to be true and Coraline's escape from the other world of button-eyed people takes quite a bit of courage. Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. He has written a story in our own time that is destined to be a classic for years to come. Luckily, he writes books for adults as well. This is the type of book that I absolutely must hold on to so that I can read it to my children oneday (when I finally every do have children).</td></tr><tr><td>Marian Keyes' ANGELS is the best kind of beach read -- funny, loving, and ultimately respectful of all its characters.  Maggie Walsh comes to Los Angeles for all the reasons that most of us come to Los Angeles -- our hearts are broken and we can't think of what comes next, and joining the Foreign Legion is not an option.  Her L.A. adventure rings true, and she gets the happy ending we all deserve.  Hurray!</td></tr><tr><td>Loved the books. The story line is similar to Hunger Games. So if you liked The Hunger Games you'll love one.</td></tr><tr><td>This best selling English author of historical fiction has written yet another interesting work. This novel takes place during the reign of Mary Tudor, daughter of King Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon. She would leave a legacy that would cause her to be known as \"Bloody Mary\" for her burning of heretics. The narrator is a girl named Hannah Green, a young teenager who has fled Spain  and its Inquisition with her father, following the death of her mother. She had been burned alive at the stake as a heretic, when it was discovered that she was a \"Marrano\", a false Christian, that is, a  Jew who has converted to Christianity but who follows the Jewish faith in secret. Landing in London, where her father opens a book store, Hannah makes the acquaintance of a handsome rake, Sir Robert Dudley, who discovers that Hannah has the gift of sight. She develops a personal relationship with him that eventually sees her enter into Queen Mary's service as her fool. Hannah serves Queen Mary, but at the same time, is sent by the Queen to serve her half-sister the Princess Elizabeth and spy upon her. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Dudley also uses Hannah in his treasonous plot to see the Princess Elizabeth on the throne of England. So, Hannah finds herself walking a dangerous tightrope and is fearful of discovery of her role in the political intrigues that are welling around her, as well as discovery of her own background, which would be grounds for death. Her worst fears are nearly realized when the Queen marries Prince Phillip of Spain. In the midst of all this political intriguing that appears to be going on all around her, Hannah has her own immediate future to think about, as she becomes betrothed to another Marrano such as herself. Infatuated with Lord Dudley, loyal to both Queen Mary and the clever and manipulative Princess Elizabeth, Hannah finds herself putting her own future happiness at risk amidst the political and religious  turmoil of the time. This is a fast paced, breezy read about an independent, young woman who finds herself at a crossroad in her life and begins a voyage of self-discovery that will ultimately change her life. The story takes place in sixteenth century England, amidst all the political strife and religious upheaval of the time. The author weaves an intriguing tapestry of historical events and personages together with the intrigues that were rife in the Tudor court of the Queen who would become known as Bloody Mary.</td></tr><tr><td>Once again, Tracy Chevalier, author of a number of well-written works of historical fiction, lets her imagination run wild, weaving her story around another actual work of art. In this book, the author builds her story around the series of medieval tapestries known as \"The Lady and the Unicorn\", currently hanging in a museum in France, creating a work of historical fiction that is somewhat interesting and moderately enjoyable. Although not as well written as her best selling novel, \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\", or even her debut novel, \"The Virgin Blue\", those who like their historical fiction with some romantic overtones will be pleased with the author's efforts. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a talented, handsome, and cocky painter, Nicolas des Innocents, is commissioned to design and paint scenes depicting the Battle of Nancy for a series of tapestries. His paintings would then be enlarged in preparation for having the images woven into tapestries by a master weaver in Brussels. The commission is given to Nicholas by a prominent French nobleman, Jean Le Viste, a cold man who is given to self-importance and wishes to memorialize his status, as his star is on the ascendancy in the Royal Court. Nicolas soon discovers, however, that it was Jean Le Viste's wife, Genevieve de Nanterre, who suggested him for the commission. She lets him know, however, that she does not wish for the tapestries to depict the Battle of Nancy but, rather, scenes of a lady and a unicorn. Genevieve de Nanterre, a pious and unhappily married woman, leaves it to him to convince her husband that this new idea should replace the Battle of Nancy as the subject of the tapestries. Nicolas manages to do this, and so it begins. Nicolas is not only a fine painter but also a confirmed lothario who falls for Le Viste's daughter, a beautiful teenager named Claude. Of course, Nicholas has already dallied with Marie-Celeste, one of the household's maids with the usual, not unexpected, result, a fact that will eventually lead to some serious personal consequences for him. Meanwhile, Genevieve de Nanterre, who would rather be a nun than married to Jean Le Viste, discovers that her daughter reciprocates the painter's passion. Claude is ultimately shipped off to a nunnery to repent for her sins and to remain chaste until a suitable betrothal may be made for her. Genevieve's motives in doing so, however, are not wholly altruistic. Eventually, Nicholas travels to the workshop of master weaver Georges de la Chappelle, who has been selected to convert the paintings to tapestries. Nicholas meets with cartoonist, Philippe de la Tour, to ensure that the tapestries stay true to his paintings and that the process of enlarging them does not substantively change his seductive design. Of course, his stay in Brussels is made more pleasant by the fact that Georges de la Chappelle has a lovely daughter named Alienor, who is ripe for the picking. Unfortunately, her father, for business reasons, wishes to marry her off to the local tanner, a smelly brute whose noxious scent is a result of an expected occupational hazard. Unbeknownst to them all, however, Alienor has a secret admirer, whose love will eventually make right all that goes wrong. This is a mildly entertaining novel in which the underlying theme is seduction. The tale is told from the perspectives of each of the main characters through individual first person narratives. The lives of some of them become intertwined, because Nicolas des Innocents has come into contact with them. The story describes their lives and loves, as well as the impact that their lives have on the actual tapestries. The novel also gives a good deal of interesting information on the weavers' guild of the time and its practices, as well as information on the painstaking art of weaving high quality tapestries, such as that of \"The Lady and the Unicorn\". It should be noted that the cover of the hardcover book is of unusual quality. When one removes the dust jacket, the boards are embossed with a lovely image taken from the actual tapestry.</td></tr><tr><td>I still love reading this classic.</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a great read.  Barbara's life experience connects with mine.  It is practical and down to earth.  She probes simple things and goes deep.</td></tr><tr><td>A not-so-new island coming up from the sea causes diplomatic tension between Ankh-Morpork and its powerful neighbor, Klath. The tensions soon lead to a military confrontation - and yes, there's a problem. Only one side of the conflict has an army. Moreover, the army in question is led by a competent general, Ashal. Ankh-Morpork armed \"forces\" do include surprisingly good soldiers (like Willikins), but it is more than clear that they have not even a single goodish officer. The only one that is not a complete idiot turns out to be... oh, read for yourselves. Little wonder the Klathians consider the war as a huge joke arranged for their amusement. There's only one way to stop the ultimate destruction of the biggest city on Disc - diplomacy. With some support of idiot actions taken by people who either never dreamed to be considered soldiers (Vimes) or those who thought it's their birthright to be called officers (Rust) the necessary steps are taken. And it all leads to an ... interesting end! I admit I personally tell the difference between an \"interesting\" and \"potentially interesting\" Discworld book by checking out how much space is given to Vetinari, and I find that \"Jingo\" is absolutely satisfying. Take the \"donkey-minaret\" thing. For all those of you who don't like Carrot=Superman thing, read the book. Oh, he does turn out to be abnormally clever and nice, but at least it doesn't make a big difference. For the Vimes's fans - read it, too. The man never claimed to be a soldier, after all. Vetinari's supporters will find themselves overhelmed with pure joy and purring . And it is nice to meet the other old friends - Angua, Detritius, Dorfl. I strongly recommend reading earlier Watch books before this one, you'll miss too many jokes if you start with Jingo. A must-read. Pratchett at his best.</td></tr><tr><td>So let me just say that I loved Divergent ! That being said, when Divergent ended the possibilities were endless for Tris and Four. All of them could have been epic. But where they ended up in this book was more tragic than epic. I had high hopes for Four and Tris. But it seems the main theme of this book is pain and torture. We left off with Tris, Four , Marcus, Caleb and Peter on the train , we pick up in the same spot. But that's where things take a big twist. I will say that this book was full of action, non-stop action. But those moments between Four and Tris were few and far between. I was hoping for so much more....... So we have Tris, who is still suffering from the events that just recently happened. Who can't seem to be able to move forward. What happened to the kick-butt Tris we have come to love? Four ? or is it Tobias?----oh wait it's Four... Well talk about a multiple personality disorder. One minute he's brave and total Dauntless, and the next he might as well be Fractionless. One minute he's hot next he's cold. His mood swing's are giving me a major migraine. Then we have all those , well no we don't because those characters that could have been memorable have seemed to either disappear or be killed off. Which seems to happen a lot . So while I kept turning the page , just so I would know what happens. This was not much of a page turner. As the Mad Hatter would say, \" Your not the same as you were before. You were much more....\"muchier\". You've lost your \"muchness\". Between Divergent and Insurgent something was lost... I was so sure that this series was bound for epic-ness..</td></tr><tr><td>As a colonial American history buff, I loved this gem of a novel. I don't understand why it hasn't received more attention. The era and the characters were wonderfully imagined -- authentic-sounding (to me) dialogue and exactly the right amount of always relevant historical detail of 18th-century life. I didn't want the widow's story to end, and I'm hereby pleading with Sally Gunning (hope she reads these comments!) to abandon writing contemporary mysteries and give us another book like The Widow's War.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent book. This really opened my eyes to the history and potential of comics. Great read for kids interested in pursuing comics as a career and parents distressed about their kids reading so many comic books!</td></tr><tr><td>Truly revelatory and helpful instruction.</td></tr><tr><td>\"Putt Like the Pros,\" by Dave Pelz (with Nick Mastroni), contains much helpful information about putting. The book is divided into five parts, as follows: the research on putting, the mechanics of putting, feel and touch in putting, the implements of putting, the mental side of putting. The book is amply illustrated with appropriate photographs and drawings, which give the reader a better idea of what Pelz is saying in the text. Following Pelz's advice will certainly improve one's putting game. The one downside is that Pelz spends a lot of time trying to sell his special aids to putting. While I have nothing against this per se, the truth is that much of what Pelz is trying to get you to do with these putting aids can be done without them. Also, by the end of the book I was still not convinced as to the extent to which being a good putter depends on follow Pelz's advice and how much depends on persistent practice. At one point Pelz says that to be really good you will need to make 20,000 strokes using his technique. That sounds like a lot. It also sounds like much of what makes for good putting is a result of putting in the time on the practice green. I have seen golfers with seemingly impeccable putting technique who are terrible putters, and some who are great putters who look like they have no clue what they are doing. In the end, it may be that what makes one a really good putter is what makes a person really good at just about everything else--thousands of hours of practice. If so, Pelz's advice might help, but it will only be a small part of what improves your putting game.</td></tr><tr><td>Without a doubt this book is a great read. Whether you know a lot about economics or just a little, this book is just pure fun. The anecdotes and information are simply fun to read about. From drug dealers to sumo wrestling, this book covers a remarkably broad range of topics and sometimes draws connections between them in striking ways. It is important to note though, that these results are not there to make the reader happy. It is very possible that some readers may find his results concerning more serious topics like abortion or parenting to be troubling or at odds with their own belief systems. In these cases it is important to continue reading with as objective a mindframe as possible. While some pieces of evidence seem incomplete, especially in the section on parenting, Levitt and Dubner work hard to back up their conclusions with as much data as possible. One thing I never felt while reading this book was that the authors were pushing any type of agenda. They simply followed data to what they saw as it's logical conclusions. In short, this book is a wonderful exercize in curiosity and creativity. If you only know a bit about economics, or think that it's all about the federal reserve and interest rates, you'll be introduced to a wonderful new world of exciting conclusions. If you do know a lot about economics and are expecting revelations, you will be dissapointed. This book should be viewed more as a pop science book than a serious essay on economics and I would imagine that that is what the authors intended. That having been said, a person who knows a lot about economics can still enjoy the book for its entertainment value. This is a great read for anyone with a little bit of curiosity. Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>My husband loves to read!</td></tr><tr><td>Love going on car trips and listening to the late Joan Hickson, aka the best Miss Marple ever, read the Miss Marple stories. Very well done. I find myself having 'parking lot moments' - those times when you've arrived at your destination, but still want to continue listening. I've even had those moments in my own garage.</td></tr><tr><td>Nice and new.</td></tr><tr><td>Practical and down to earth</td></tr><tr><td>This was precisely what I expected from this series of books. I have loved the Odd Thomas series from the start. While it is starting to look a little like Mr Koontz churns these out like cookies, it is still an enjoyable addition to the 'franchise'. Evil is still pervading the world and Odd is still bumping into weird and wacky oddball sidekicks in his fight against the end of the world. What more could you want? While it's not exactly literature gold, it's amusing and entertaining enough. Keep 'em coming; they make great little rest stops along the highway of reading pleasure.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good read but only just that, good, not great, not even very good. The author does a great job in creating some new and wondrous worlds for the Time Traveler. I was enthralled by the worlds he created. But boy o boy does this book drone on. I hate skipping parts of a book. I usually want to read every word and not miss one piece of the story. But in \"The Time Ships\" I found myself often bored to tears and skimming over whole pages. Portions that were intriguing and wondrous very regularly evolved slowly into monotonous and bleak hazes of explanations and political views I was not interested in. I admit I enjoy fast paced action in my sci-fi but, if a book is written well, I can still be engrossed it, it just has to be entertaining and well written. \"Rendezvous with Rama\" is a great example of a book without a whole lot of action yet so well written you can hardly to put it down. It took me weeks to read \"The Time Ships\". I would often find myself waking after a nice nap and having only finished a few pages. Yet Baxter gives us a big enough glimpse of what time travel might be to keep us going back for more even though we know following the excitement we are bound to find page after page of dullness. This would be a superb story were it written in only 350 pages. Go ahead and buy it if you are a die-hard sci-fi reader with lots of time on your hands. Not that 520 pages will take that much time, it's all the naps in between that will consume you. And one more thing, don't be fooled by the title, the actual Time Ships are a very small and somewhat minor portion of the total story.</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Jenkins at age 22 and freshly degreed was smart enough to realize that his knowledge of American life was really quite narrow and heavily influenced by his upper middle class background. He hit upon a walk across America as means to gain perspective. The foremost fact of his journey was its sheer difficulty: having to endure hunger, cold, loneliness, sickness, etc. There is no way anyone could anticipate that and Peter did not. But his purpose had a lot more to do with the people that he hoped to encounter. But his contacts with people actually were quite limited and were almost exclusively with rural people (except towards the end). It would be hard to make any general claims concerning the general character of the American people based on Jenkins' journey. He had some good experiences with people and some not so good, even frightening. Most people were civil to him if that is the claim. Some of his experiences were quite compelling. He had great rapport with a reclusive mountain man in Virginia that he stumbled upon and visited for three days. By far the most noteworthy experience of the journey was the four months that he spent living with a black family in cramped quarters in Murphy, NC while becoming a part of the entire community including backbreaking work at a sawmill. But just prior to arriving in Murphy the white law enforcement officials of Robbinsville, NC threatened to hang him if he did not leave town - there goes any general goodness theory. Other highlights of the journey were meeting and being pleasantly surprised by George Wallace, the governor of Alabama, and meeting his future wife in New Orleans. Less compelling aspects of the journey were the showing up of his family members at various points of the journey which detracts from his self-discovery assignment and a turn towards religious overtones as the book progressed. For purposes of rating the book, it hard to separate the book from the journey. Any rating of the book is bound to influenced by whether the reviewer found the journey to be compelling. The book is written simply - no pontification. Personally for this reviewer two aspects of the book/journey stand out: the physical effort of the journey and the various personal encounters. There is no great lesson to be learned from the journey. Life is an accumulation of journeys - so to speak.</td></tr><tr><td>I have recently become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I enjoy her stories and her writing---always very interesting and compelling. I ordered her older books after reading \"Plain Truth\". And I'm so glad I did. This novel was gripping from the first page--I had a hard time putting it down. Having known \"kids\" who were very similar to Chris and Emily, I believe that I understood their feelings about their love, their being \"joined at the hip\", the families being closely tied together. I also understood the painful reality of a young girl feeling so desperate that suicide would be the only way out of her pain. It was so real--and powerful to read. I couldn't put it down------except that I was reading it in the midst of our nation's terrible tragedy on Sept. 11---and found it was too painful to read about Emily's death when thousands of other deaths were happening in real life. I had to take a rest for a couple of days-----and finally finished it last night. A powerful ending to a tremendous story. I hope Jodi Picoult continues to write such terrific stories. She's one of my newest favorites and I'll continue to read her books.</td></tr><tr><td>This author takes the time to develop believable characters in both humans and aliens.  I found this entertaining and hard to put down.  I look forward to reading more of Karen's books.</td></tr><tr><td>Very well written.  Reminds me of stories I heard in  my childhood.</td></tr><tr><td>Olson and Roberts, take the myth of John Wayne and place it (him) into the proper historical context and create a vivid, complete, fascinating and ultimately revealing portrait of one of film's most famous and enduring stars. John Wayne: American, is not only about Marion Micheal Morrison, the gangly Iowa kid who grew up to become an Icon, but also about the American myth machine. Olson and Roberts include intriguing insights into the Hollywood dream factories, politics and the craft of acting. Wayne comes off here as a suprisingly complex man who not only proved to be a fine actor but an astute business man who willingly allowed himself to be co-opted as a profitable commodity by not only the Hollywood system but by the political arena as well as the American cult of personality. Whether for well or ill,  Wayne came to rdefine not only entire generations of men but also a national identity as well. The book does honestly deal with the fact that Wayne cocooned himself within the sanctity of the manufactured image and took great pains to maintain that carefully constructed product. But what a product it was. Olson and Roberts are reverant to their subject while managing to lend the critical eye a terrible aspect. This book is refreshing in its honesty. Admirable for its respectful treatment. And thoroughly entertaining and enlightening in its detail. Watch Wayne's films and enjoy this book.</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book as a teenager and was so taken by it that I would reread it several years in a row.  Its picture of life after a nuclear war is harrowing and frightening.  In a sense, this is a prelude of the story that concludes with \"On the Beach\".  The only problem is that Frank writes so well and  gives such a hopeful slant to the possibility of survival that some readers might want to be there when the missles start to fall.  (By the way, this much superior to that mess of a movie \"The Day After\"--and, oh how I wish, it would have made a splendid film.  I believe it was made as a Playhouse 90 for TV in the 50s.  Oh, would I love to see that!)</td></tr><tr><td>Another fun and suspenseful read.  Love the characters!</td></tr><tr><td>Great book!</td></tr><tr><td>(Confession: This is the first book by Terry Pratchett that I've ever read!) I love me some post-apocalyptic fiction. So I liked this book. It is extremely well-written. Actually, maybe it's a little too well-written because I felt Mau's desperation so vividly that every time I got a few minutes to read, I hesitated picking the book up. I didn't always feel like being completely and utterly transported to that world. But I think what always kept me coming back is the humor. Not laugh-out-loud funny, but a-quiet-chuckle-and-sometimes-a-groan funny. Here, some survivors from another island are trying to explain horses to Mau, who's never seen them before:   \"...And the horses! Oh, everyone should see the horses!\"   \"What are horses?\" [said Mau.]   \"Well, they're...well, you know hogs?\" said Pilu.   \"Better than you can imagine.\"   \"...Well, they are not like hogs. But if you took a hog and made it bigger and longer, with a longer nose and a tail, that's a horse. Oh, and much more handsome. And much longer legs.\"   \"So a horse is not really like a pig at all?\"   \"Well, yes, I suppose so. But it's got the same number of legs.\"</td></tr><tr><td>This book offers many interesting examples that make you think.</td></tr><tr><td>Such a great, continuing series with imperfect, human characters, genuine plot development, & real suspense. I highly recommend the whole arc.</td></tr><tr><td>... for our openness to supernatural beliefs of all kinds, religious \"psychic\", or simply superstitious. Prof Hood develops his argument with repeated appeals to common experience and to experimental data. The author, a professor of developmental psychology, relates these to the way our minds work, just as optical illusions are related to the way our visual cortex works. For example, from early in life, we regard physical objects as being moved by mental forces. That is the way we inevitably continue to feel about our own bodies, even if philosophically we know that this is absurd. Hence the supernatural belief that events must have a \"why\" as well as a \"how\". This is only one of several important ideas developed here, but I won't go into more detail for fear of spoiling your pleasure in reading this book. Whether you are a believer or an unbeliever is not going to be changed by reading this book, nor is that the intention, but what will be changed is your degree of insight into your own mind and the minds of others.</td></tr><tr><td>I. COULD. NOT. PUT. THIS. BOOK. DOWN!!!!!  A MUST READ FOR MANSON FANS!</td></tr><tr><td>This was a surprisingly engaging read that is in severe need of editing in the first few chapters. I nearly tossed the e-book on the virtual trash heap because the author consistently confused \"The Drag\" (the strip of Guadalupe that runs along the west side of the University of Texas main campus) with \"Sixth Street\"; at the time the events occurred \"Sixth Street\" referred to to portion of Sixth Street between IH-35 and Congress Avenue, it's grown since then) and as a 29 year resident of Austin, this made me extremely suspicious about the quality of the research that had gone into the book. However, I'm glad I stuck it out.  Those glaring errors only appear in the first chapter they are introduced and later are corrected to refer to \"Sixth Street\" as, well, \"Sixth Street\". It's obvious where the authors sympathies lie, and I really do wish she could get over the fact that Colton Pitonyak sported a goatee, which appears to be evidence to the author of his descent into drug addicted psychopathic behavior, rather than how any guy under 50 with any pretension of being cool kept his facial hair at the time, in Austin. However, the author sticks mercifully to the facts, and doesn't do a lot of fictionalized retelling of events that noone could possibly recount because no one was there to witness.  I LOATHE that in True Crime books, that tactic belongs in a Lifetime Movie not a documentary/biography.  What worked for me was that the individuals involved in the case, and even some of the more peripheral players, were fully fleshed out and made whole, and real.  I actually found myself identifying and sympathizing with the victim and her family.  What also worked for me is that there are some obvious unanswered questions that the author presents the facts for, asks the questions, but leaves you to ponder, rather than tell you what to believe.  Like, did Pitonyak's parents know more than they admitted, when Laura Cave's mother and stepfather called looking for her, when their son was already on his way to Mexico? I live within a few miles of where the crimes took place and it was all over the news, but that made me a harsher critic, not more forgiving.  I was hoping to find more detail than had been relayed in newspapers and news stories and that goal was met - in many ways, I wish now that I had stuck with knowing less.  This was a gruesome murder and a deeply affecting book. I'd have given this 5 stars if not for the glaring mistakes and the author's weird prejudice against goatees.</td></tr><tr><td>A boy and his pet fox are forcibly separated.  This book narrates their search to rejoin one another through the eyes of each one.  That is the plot of this book and the limit of its originality.  It's real plot is the preaching to be true to your true self.  In the process it promotes a strong anti-war message.  In all, not much of a book.</td></tr><tr><td>This book was finished too soon. Fun read. Stephanie is improving as a bounty hunter. Thank goodness. Still funny though.</td></tr><tr><td>i was very disappointed with this book i thought it was some major piece before buying and like the kids was goofing off and the whole thing was programmed and recalculating the course and like it did get scary but it was not all that...</td></tr><tr><td>The reading done by Simon Vance is by far a better listen.</td></tr><tr><td>Although silly at times, this swashbuckler is an entertaining and historically accurate tag along with Napoleon during his Egyptian campaign. This is the way to learn history!</td></tr><tr><td>It good it good it good it good it good it good it good it good it good it good it good. IT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&cool. I really liked this book. Hi. I read it.</td></tr><tr><td>Since it is my turn to recommend a book for our local book club, I remembered reading \"Cold Sassy Tree\" many years ago and really enjoying it.  I decided to reread it.  I enjoyed it more that I even remembered.  I will recommend it.  I do believe every student of American literature should read it.  I can't see how anyone would not enjoy it. I actually began rereading it on an old copy that I had, but the book began to fall apart. So I ordered it on my Kindle.  Then I had to spent about a week traveling.  I had brought  my I pad.  So I read most of it on my Ipad.  I enjoyed it so much that I wanted a written copy.  I then ordered the book from Amazon. I did recommend it to be read in August.  I am anxious to see if everyone else enjoys it as much as I did.</td></tr><tr><td>Guy Gavriel Kay is one of fantasy's more individual authors: First, unlike most of his contemporaries, he has abandoned the seriesfor stand alone works; second, each of his books takes place within different and distinct worlds loosely based upon actual historic periods; and, finally, his writing is more mature and skilled than the majority of his peers, verging in style upon that of the traditional historical romance. In \"Lions of Al-Rasshad\" Kay turns to the period of Moorish Spain for the backdrop to his tale, interweaving the cultural and political conflicts between Moslem, Jew, and Aryan nobility, each struggling to retain their cultural heritage while attempting to achieve dominance over their cultural as well as religious foes.  Typical of Kay's work since the \"Fionovar Trilogy,\" the resolution of their mutual struggles and intrigues are neither conclusive nor entirely expected, elevating the story above the typical good triumphing over evil common to fantasy tales.  Nor are Kay's characters reduced to architypal caricutures, but instead are motivated by personal  and often conflicting motives all too human to be viewed simply in terms of right and wrong.  And, as always, Kay brings to his work a freshness in approach that makes his work stand apart from the  rest of contemporary fantasy.</td></tr><tr><td>I've read Gone With the Wind many times since i first read it at 13. I've loved it every time and each time, I've read a new book, it seems. Each time, I've had a new appreciation for different aspects of this, the Great American novel. The only book I can think of that comes close is To Kill  Mockingbird. Never have characters been more fully delineated; never has a chapter of history been brought more to life. This book is exciting, romantic and insightful. No amount of stars would be enough.</td></tr><tr><td>Because it's based on the input from the postings to the message board which started after her first book, the concepts are illustrated with very real examples. It serves the very real need to provide support to those who do not have a local depression partner support group.</td></tr><tr><td>Exciting and hard to put down. As usual, Mr. Iles is the master of having several plots all occurring at the same time and then weaving them together a little past halfway through the book. This novel has a message but is not \"preachy\" and gives the reader enough historical fact to cause him/her an opportunity to think about past and present racial prejudices. It also leaves the reader anxious to read the next novel in the trilogy (The Bone Tree). Thank you Mr. Iles for this well-written, thoughtful novel.</td></tr><tr><td>\"Over Tumbled Graves\" is set on Spokane, Washington, a city which is noted for the waterfalls along the river that runs through it.  The opening of the book is set at these falls when a young police detective, Caroline Marby, must chose between saving the life of the drug dealer or shooting the buyer who threw him into the falls.  This choice, the choice between death and the preservation of life, is one of many threads that run through this book and make it a rich treat for the tired fan of the serial killer genre. Caroline, with her friend and mentor Alan Dupree, become involved in a hunt for a killer who leaves his prostitute victims strangled and shot, grasping their last payment in their hands.  The chain of evidence points to Caroline's escaped drug buyer, Lenny Ryan, as the killer but he remains somehow intangible, appearing and disappearing almost at will, with an agenda which never seems quite clear.  As Caroline and Alan investigate, their present relationship as not quite lovers hovers between them.  He is married and Caroline has a live-in.  The tension between the two reflects the rapids that run through the city, as separation that can never be truely bridged. As the body count mounts, Dupree, who is heading the investigation, is forced to call in FBI profilers.  His sarcastic intolerance of these men and unwillingness to use modern investigative techniques puts him at odds with his superiors, and he is eventually removed from the case.  This widens the division between him and Caroline as she must pick up many of the threads Dupree left hanging.  Dupree, trying to deal with his frustration and a failing marriage, returns to the streets that he started on. The book is also the tale of the conflict between the two profilers.  Curtis Blanton, a retired FBI profiler, sarcastic and sharp witted is an almost unwilling participant.  For him the case has two low a body count to be worth the efforts of a profiler.  Jeffrey McDaniel, on loan from the FBI is condescending and overblown.  For him the case is an opportunity to show up Blanton.  Neither man adds much to the investigation, although their rivalry quickly becomes the comic relief of the story. Caroline, caught in between the profilers, as she is between Dupree and his replacement Spivey, must piece together the truth out of the tiniest of shreds and suspicions.  The final answer is unexpected and complex.  To say that Jess Walter is a master of misdirection would be a serious understatement. The action flows beautifully, building slowly from the moment the first body is discovered.  Hardly sparse, there is still little waste in the telling, although I wish that Walter had spent just a bit more effort on the setting.  Other than the river itself, Spokane and its environs never quite come to life the way the characters do.  The story is a melancholy one, turning on tragedy and loss and the tiny steps that lead one from self-interest to evil.  Redeeming qualities are found in unexpected places and the reader is left with much to consider in the end.  Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>this book is very useful to understanding the logic behind most people's (my) eating patterns. The book gives practical guide to achieving saitey while reducing overall calories. it has been instrumental to my weight loss success - 20 pounts and counting.</td></tr><tr><td>Intriguing from the beginning, but sadly does not hold any real suspense.. disjointed and lacking a grand finale..twisted plot and hard to like any of the main characters</td></tr><tr><td>Coldheart Canyon is an interesting book.  I will give it four stars, because it is closer to four than to three, but it deserves little more than 3 and a half. The idea is an interesting one, and it's fun to see Barker dropping Hollywood names, current and past, into the mix. In CC, Barker really goes for the gross out.  This is tough to type with a straight face, given the man's propensity for painting gore with the most vivid brush imaginable, but here it seems he resorts to gag-inducing ideas for lack of anything else popping into his brain. Sex is once again, a HUGE topic in this book, and not just of the living human/living human variety.  Ghosts, humans, animals, demons, they all like to get their swerve on in this tale.  The amounts of bodily fluids and solids bandied about in this novel are staggering. The book goes on too long, as well, and could have used a nice 100-page trimming. Despite all this, Barker's imagination never ceases to amaze.  After writing Weaveworld, Imajica, The Great and Secret Show, Everville etc, I would have assumed that his wellspring of strange characters, names and concepts might have run dry by now.  Not so.  Where else would you find the devil's son, a goat boy with bad anal hygiene and an extreme weakness for breasts tell you his name is Qweftzalfoni? (or something like that anyway...) Barker still commands the ability to create worlds, to make seemingly ridiculous concepts (a tiled room that comes alive and draws you into it) work.  This is not his best work, but he is still better than a LOT of authors out there.</td></tr><tr><td>Melville is the ultimate in 19th century writers. Verbose, erudite, in Moby Dick he has written the perfect combination book of natural history and novel. His digressive essays on the whale's head (unbelievably big), the difference between right and sperm whales, who claims the right to loose and fast whales, and other events involved in whaling are all intertwined with in depth character sketches of the crew, Ahab, and Ishmael himself. Meeting other ships at sea is a special bonus bringing us into the very voyage itself. A fantastic read, which at times, leaves the reader surprised and laughing out loud at the humorous asides. Can't go wrong. Make this a summer read or reread. Made my prolonged winter go faster!</td></tr><tr><td>Bought this book to read for a book club.  Found it rather slow going even though this is a noted author.</td></tr><tr><td>This author is a great writer, has well developed characters and a few twists and turns along the way.  I object to the constant use of vulgar language which is totally unnecessary with an author of this caliber.</td></tr><tr><td>This book kept my attention!  The setting of Cumberland Island and the suspense of the murders keeps the reader enthralled.</td></tr><tr><td>Not at all what I expected.</td></tr><tr><td>A Daddy loving by doing makes this book one I hug, and my students into middle school did, too.  I used it with my beginning ESOL students who could read/sing finding delight and fluency.  They haven't \"met\" Elvis Presley yet but they have felt the affection between the father and daughter.  I especially liked that golf was included in their activities.  The new generation which received my latest gift of this book will be tickled that there are golfers in this book anyway.  Most of my dearest stories have dated activities-not this one.  Bravo!  I think I have now purchased for school and family about 20 copies since the book first came out.  That's new for me.</td></tr><tr><td>A great effort from both authors. Great premise, well executed, but something about it feels a bit off, that perhaps the collaboration wasn't entirely smoothed out. Not enough to detract from the novel, though.</td></tr><tr><td>Some of the reviews I read before I bought this would make you think Mr. Ornish is a Nazi.  In a society where we are looking for a pill to cure everything instead of using a little self discipline I suppose you could think that.  This book is a simple straight forward approach to eating the way nature designed us instead of the way fast food has trained us.  If you're looking for a healthy life and maybe to drop some pounds too, and you are ready to be realistic about it, buy this book and his cookbook.  The food is great and you won't miss the stuff you give up.</td></tr><tr><td>This is an outstanding book about beer, broken down by type and even offers descriptions of common brands. A great buy for a beer enthusiest.</td></tr><tr><td>Senator Hagel offers a clear headed and candid assessment of where America stands today and where it needs to go, particularly on the international front. Readers may find his analysis jolting in comparison to the timidity of other officials, but those who know Hagel will find his remarks as standard. In listening to an interview of author Stephen Covey recently, I noted Covey's assessment that those who come from an agrarian experience are more likely to face the reality of people and events. That fits with Hagel and his upbringing in Nebraska. While many of Hagel's assessments parallel my own (Congress has failed in its responsibility to be a co-equal branch of government, the use of mercenaries in Iraq is unacceptable, we need a universal service program to instill interest in our duties as citizens) he stops short of making the hard recommendation that what we really need to accomplish those things is to go back to a lottery Draft (or to threaten President Bush with Impeachment). Hagel also offers a blunt critique of the difficulties our political process is inflicting on the ability of government to function efficiently and confront the large scale problems of our nation. The Senator strongly hints that a revision of that political process is near with either the creation of a third party or the re-constitution of an existing party. Would that more of our Federal elected officials operate with his perspective that his oath is to \". . .America, not to a President or a political party or a policy.\" His absence from the Senate will be a loss from that organization, but I expect his presence in a new administration, regardless of which party gains the Presidency in 2008. I strongly recommend his book for its unique insider perspectives and unflinching assessment of the reality of our circumstances. [...]</td></tr><tr><td>The explanation of how the storms converged and of New England fishing was on the mark.  The story line pulle it all together really well.</td></tr><tr><td>Great book.  It lays a solid foundation for how to approach and think about starting your own small business or restructuring a current business.</td></tr><tr><td>This book answered many of the questions Christians have about some apparent discrepancies in the Bible.  The author has an extensive education on the original languages of the Bible, making it possible for him to do research most of us are incapable of.  He also has a ministerial education, and therefore is qualified to draw informed theological conclusions regarding scriptural texts. This book gives me a new view on reading and understanding scriptures. Makes me want to read the Bible again, possibly with a better understanding.</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed the book but It took a while for me to get through it.  The author paints a detailed picture with short sentences. I had to take break often to absorb.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved this book as I have every one of Liane Moriarty's!</td></tr><tr><td>A VERY WELL WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE DURING THE NAZI ERA.</td></tr><tr><td>As an attorney, it was terrific. As an Italiophile,  it was splendid. Did I invent a word?  You know what I mean.!</td></tr><tr><td>Fair book. Good for the beach or plane. Felt hurried at end when Nesbo did the final wrap up of main plot.</td></tr><tr><td>Didn't love the story.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good story told in flashbacks. I enjoyed it very much.  It is very sad how barbaric early psycharitry was, and how vulnerable some women were.</td></tr><tr><td>Very interesting content. I am enjoying my reading.</td></tr><tr><td>The Odd Thomas series is excellent and the action is unpredictable.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved the Delphi Kindle edition of Wilde's works.  I have only read the short stories yet, but it is great to have the complete works on my iPad.  Many of the short stories are explicitly Christian, but Christ himself making a personal appearing in the \"Selfish Giant\".</td></tr><tr><td>this is a great book! you need to read it slowly as it can get confusing. there is a chart at the beginning which helps with keeping all characters straight. loved this story.</td></tr><tr><td>Great</td></tr><tr><td>Written more than a century ago, Jack London's tale of a family dog kidnapped and sent to Alaska to work pulling sleds still works well today as a story of adventure and survival. As well as telling the story of Buck's transition from family pet to hardened work dog and eventually wild creature through Buck's eyes, we also learn about the lives of the men who settled and worked in the rugged north of Canada and Alaska. The scenery is so well described you can almost visualize it and feel the cold and the hardships that men and dogs had to survive to eke out a living. Wonderful stuff!</td></tr><tr><td>Incredible story.  Don't know why it took so long to make a movie about this hero.  Unfortunately it also ruined my perception of the Japanese and their warrior culture.  The immorality of how they treated POW's is hard to understand.</td></tr><tr><td>I have read all the Scottoline books up until this one. I Think this one is the most unbelieveable of any I have read. It is very hard to discuss the book and not give away the ending. Judy Carrier is trying to get the jury to believe Anthony \"Pigeon Tony\" Lucia did not kill Angelo Coluzzi. This is after Pigeon Tony admits he did kill him. Go figure. The Coluzzi family trys to get to Judy and attempts to kill Pigeon Tony. The book will hold you attention, I give it that. It is also very funny in places. The names are great, such a Pigeon Tony, Tony From Down the Block and Tony Two Feet. This is so people won't get the Tonys mixed up. I did not like the flashbacks that Pigeon Tony had, supposed to make you know why he felt like he did but I thought they were way to long. Would like to tell you what I thought was so unbelieveabe but would give away the ending to do that. Part of the book was very good but the flashbacks and the ending was a downer for me.</td></tr><tr><td>I think that is one of Hill's best in the Dalziel and Pascoe series.  He has created a story that is eery and mystical.  The story begins with three little girls going missing from a small town called Danby.  At the same time as these girls are being searched for by a much younger Andy Dalziel, the whole village of Danby is preparing to be submerged in water as a reservoir is being constructed on the old townsite.  This is what makes this book so tantalizing.  We keep slipping back to when the village of Danby was drowned and all the terrible things that happened then (which is 15 years before the setting for this book), and a new horror has occurrred in the present time when another little girl goes missing.  Dazliel and his crew are trying to solve both cases, and Pascoe is dealing with a personal issue that threatens his very existance.  How Hill manages to keep all these balls in the air, and the tenuous strings that he has intertwined between the many different plots in this book is pure genius.  I would consider this book to be a masterpiece of writing.  There are so many things at play here that it's hard to classify this novel.  Is it a psychological thriller?  Yes, but it is so much more - a mystery, a ghost story, a dramatic story and another wonderful stop in the lives of these people that I care about so much by now - the many-layered Dazliel, and the scholarly and introverted Pascoe.</td></tr><tr><td>Not bad. Was hoping for more. Doesn't always follow story line of show, which was annoying. Would have been cooler if had more lore from show.</td></tr><tr><td>I almost can't put into words the reason I enjoyed this book, but I can say that I had a hard time putting it down. It is definitely a character piece - more about the characters than a particular story. Well-written, interesting, thought-provoking but not Earth moving (which is a good thing). It also is one of the most appropriately (though unobviously) titled books I have read in a long time.</td></tr><tr><td>This and \"Cat's Cradle\" remain my favorites in the Vonnegut canon. A brilliant book from a brilliant author.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked it.  It made me see Italy, just like a did 5 years ago.</td></tr><tr><td>I thoroughly enjoyed the Divergent Series but this last book, Allegiant, was very different from the rest. Not just because it switched from Tris' voice to Tobias' but because of the surprising ending. Without giving it away, I just have to say WOW. Unexpected and not comfortable at all. Not in a  bad way, however. I would recommend these books for anyone who likes apocalyptic futuristic stories, whether you are a teen or adult. The books kept my interest throughout.</td></tr><tr><td>The book was very well written however the old fashioned English was hard to understand. Overall a very good read.</td></tr><tr><td>If youve seen the show, then the book is just as funny. It takes all of Homers advice and puts it into a cute book. I have it on my shelf next to my Duff energy drink</td></tr><tr><td>This is a classic, if you haven't read this book then you may not, now or ever, consider yourself an educated person.  Read this book, then take one look at the world around you.  He wrote this book not even a century ago, believing that the reality he described would be many, many centuries ahead of us...but it isn't....it's already coming. By Ford, we need to redesign our system.</td></tr><tr><td>Received my copy very fast, thank you.  The author is very natural and down to earth for being such an important man.  I love chuckling over his adventures.  Recommend this to all, easy reading.</td></tr><tr><td>Perfect for my 4 year old beginner reader.  He is eager to be independent with his books and not need someone to read them to him.</td></tr><tr><td>Good plot set in an unusual location - Iceland.</td></tr><tr><td>Here's another book I bought just because I liked the author's last book so much. That previous book would be Soul Enchilada, whose occasional plot glitches were completely overcome by Gill's mad writing skills and his even madder characters and YA voice. The new book takes place on a future Mars, where governments have risen and fallen, leaving behind the shreds of civilization, including our guy Durango. This kid's backstory alone is more interesting that half the books out there, and believe me, it's not dumped on readers--you have to fit the pieces together as you go along. There's a pop culture feel, let alone a wish-fulfillment feel, to this book in some ways: Durango is ex-military and has an Artificial Intelligence implanted in his head to help him out. He is also a good-looking guy and chicks love him. But Gill doesn't get carried away with Durango's appeal. It ends up merging into the plot and even being the source of some humor when Durango, like most teenage boys, doesn't read the signals he gets from the opposite sex very well. As for the AI and the military training, that ends up being part of this kid's painful backstory. Gill's Mars is a brutal place, where food is scarce and Durango takes jobs for his little team of mercenaries that are all too likely to get them killed--and don't pay well, either. The new gig requires Durango and his buddies to defend a group of miners in a formally abandoned mine in the southern polar region from a group of mutant cannibals. (This feels more realistic than it sounds, trust me!) Black Hole Sun is written in a kind of insider's shorthand, which gives it a strong sense of immediacy but does require the reader to work a little to get in sync. The effort pays off when you wind up feeling like you really are crawling along mine shafts, waiting to get your throat ripped out by the Draeu. Yes, there are hand grenades, also alien slime. But there are quieter interactions, as well, like the moments when Durango is trying to keep his cool around his lieutenant, a girl he figures he shouldn't have feelings for because he needs to be a professional and a leader. We even get some humor, most often in the form of banter between Durango and his AI, Mimi. Gill doesn't just write terse action, he builds complex characters. The members of Durango's team are a rag-tag lot, especially self-styled swashbuckler Fuse and his large, touchy, not-so-bright sidekick, Jenkins. Then there's the rich old client who wants her kidnapped daughter rescued, but not her kidnapped son. She wants a lot more than that, as it turns out. Or we meet the vicious leader of the Draeu and discover her unexpected connections to Durango's past. The miners, too, are keeping secrets, and the story ends with an ethical cliffhanger which, even so, is still a side note compared to Durango's personal journey. At least for now. (Sequel, please!) There's been some talk about the lack of sci-fi in kidlit lately, and a recent crop of books has appeared to fill the void. But this one is the most purely hardcore yet, merging dystopia with aliens and a hopeful-yet-hopeless hero's journey. An unabashedly boy book, Black Hole Sun reeks of dirt, bravado, ice, blood, treachery, and near misses. Gill's tale of an abandoned Mars colony of the future is noir disguised as action-adventure. Durango makes a fitting hero for our new millenium, which, quite frankly, is jam-packed with an uneasy mix of optimism and despair. A lot like this book. Note for Worried Parents: This one is definitely for teens, probably 14 and up unless you have a serious sci-fi fan who's a year or two younger. The violence is pretty intense, though it moves at a fast clip--I did mention cannibalism, right? A few sideways references to sex, nothing major. Mature themes overall in that Black Hole Sun is quite bleak.</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone should invest in this book if you are a non-profit and wanting to locate grants.... This has great information that will certainly help.</td></tr><tr><td>The Last Kindom is a great series about the pagan Danes and Christian people of pre-England. I am almost finished with the series. I am enjoying the books much better than the TV show. The books are well written, moving the reader at a quick pace through the adventures, with interesting characters and often humorous conversation. My only complaint is that the author and editor don't know when to break paragraphs. The books have two page paragraphs that are difficult to read. Otherwise, enjoy!  -::-:*'\"\"*:.-::-* Highly recommended ! *-::-:*'''''*:-::-* If you found this review helpful, please click yes below. Thank you.</td></tr><tr><td>Well-written beautiful book</td></tr><tr><td>Think Scooby-Doo Mysteries with hip fashionista teenagers instead of gangly pot-heads, or maybe CSI meets the O.C., and you're part of the way toward grokking Bad Kitty. Our hero Jasmine attracts trouble like cats to catnip. An otherwise innocent family vacation in Las Vegas turns pulp noir for Jasmine when a three-legged cat jumps her beside the pool, sending her screaming into someone's wedding - and their wedding cake. The cat belongs to a tearful eight-year-old boy who says someone is after him, and Jasmine is too much of a snoop to let things go. Just when it looks like Jas is in over her head, her gang of colorful friends arrives to \"rescue\" her, bearing such useful items as cowboy boots with hidden pockets for emergency lip gloss and cheap perfume/mace, and a crafty fashion gizmo called the beDazzler, which applies rhinestones to any and all apparel. Like James Bond being outfitted by Q, Jasmine gets a runway detective makeover, and the kids pile into their plush pink van to bust some bad guys. Ah, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids! Bad Kitty is a fun read. This is one of those books that I read thinking, \"Okay, this book was really not written for me,\" (me = 34-year-old, fashion-disaster dad) but I can still appreciate how much my sassy eighth-grade girls would have eaten this up when I was teaching. They would have loved the chatty, pointless conversations included as constant footnotes throughout the book (which I admit I started to skip by the end), and I'm sure the cliffhanger chapter endings would have kept them turning the page, despite my disappointment that they were sometimes fake-outs. This is a book that has teenage girls clearly in its sights, and shoots to thrill.</td></tr><tr><td>A really great composition of a chapter in English history, which at the least, was a disgrace.  At the same time as the French 'spoke'. it is a wonder to me, that the English poor, did not follow suit. Well, maybe that what was behind this process.</td></tr><tr><td>Why does this man enjoy a reputation as a medievalist? Why does he have tenure at a prestigious university? If I were to try to write a book about ancient history, I couldn't dumb it down enough to compete with this \"professor's\" endeavors. Read the first chapter and decide for yourself. I guess that Tom Wolfe is right about the current state of American college classrooms, if this Cantor is any indicator of what is being taught on campuses these days (I am Charlotte Simmons). Then again, to the people who glean their inspiration from Dan Brown % co when it comes to history and learning, I suppose that Cantor seems a sage by comparison. If you haven't studied ancient societies one iota, this book will serve you well as an introduction. For anyobe else I would suggest about a dozen other books by way of introduction. Try your hand at Fernand Braudel's HISTORY OF CIVILAZATION, HG Wells' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, and of the Cambridge or Oxford World Hisories, etc. Just put this claptrap out of your mind and don't even bother perusing it, as I made the mistake in doing. This is the second book from this \"medievalist\" I've reviewed. All I can say is that it must be a very easy task to get an A in a course he teaches at NYU. So if you you have a son or daughter taking courses there, make sure they sign up for one of his classes. No problem when it comes to outwitting the \"professor.\" Sorry to be so mean, but when it comes to medieval and ancient history, I'm a nudge. I happen to be a big fan of both Herodotus and Gibbon. Professor Cantor is bush league in comparison. No excuses for shoddy scholarship in a field you are supposed to excell in. BEK</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter wanted the complete set of Ramona so we ordered them and she loves them.</td></tr><tr><td>I watched the movie version of \"Man on Fire\" twice.  I was even more impressed the second time I saw the movie.  Then I noticed in the credits that the movie was based on a book.  I found \"Man on Fire\" hard to put down.  It is a real page turner and I got hooked by the Creasy character.  The book is different from the movie.  The book is set in Italy instead of Mexico, but the differences do not diminish either the book or the movie.  I did order the paperback book (used) that has Denzel Washington's picture on the cover.  I prefer reading paperbacks.  I do not own a kindle reader.  So far I have read the 2nd and the 3rd books in the Creasy series: \"A Perfect Kill\" and \"The Blue Ring.\"  They too were great reads.  According to Wikipedia, there are 5 Creasy novels.  The other two are (#4) \"Black Horn\" and (#5) \"Message from Hell.\"  Check out the Wikipedia page on A. J. Quinnell.  You get a better view of his work from Wikipedia than from Amazon.com.  If you enjoy action/adventure books, the Creasy series is great.  My other favorite action/adventure authors are Tom Clancy (\"Hunt for Red October\") and P.T. Deutermann (\"Hunting Season\").</td></tr><tr><td>This was my first book by this author, and I really wanted to like it since I love reading series.  I thought the first half was funny and interesting, but it went down hill from there.  The heroine is a dentist who has developed a phobia of blood after witnessing a gruesome murder.  That right there threw me off.  How was she still working? The hero needs a dentist and rescues her from the hit men that are out to get her so that she can fix his tooth before it heals.  The hero was ammusing at first, but once he had \"vampire sex\" with the heroine I didn't really like much else and wanted it to end.  I don't want to ruin it for others, so I won't go into what \"vampire sex\" is, but you probably won't like the idea any more than I did.  I also did not like that he kept a harem and did not come to terms with getting rid of it if he wanted a relationship until towards the end.  Duh! The book is mostly about the heroine trying to stay alive while fighting against her attraction to a vampire. On a good note, I liked that he wanted to make all her normal dreams come true.  I just felt like the relationship progressed a little too fast to be realistic. This book may be just ok because the author is setting us up for the rest of the series by building the world too much.  I am not sure.  If I read any more in the series, I will get them from the library.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved it!  This is a must read and I couldn't put it down.  It's easy to think this could happen in our future.</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this book and am so grateful a colleague recommended it. It is up there with 'Grey Friar's Bobby', 'The Incredible Journey', 'Black Beauty', and Paul Gallico's books 'Jenny' and 'Scruffy'. Lovely.</td></tr><tr><td>Every girl should read this, beneficial informative book. Men think & feel much differently than us, having insight into their uniqueness is helpful for a healthy relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>as wonderfully as pinochio has always been</td></tr><tr><td>While many might find Roth's world contrived, I was hooked from the get-go. A great, strong, female lead character, intense situations, and well-written action make this a great book to swallow in one weekend.</td></tr><tr><td>Hated it. Nothing but political one sided tactics. Sick of all the political correctness and not looking at both sides and then writing a book</td></tr><tr><td>Unquestionably witty...not surprised it was used directly for \"Cats\" on stage.</td></tr><tr><td>This novel will not disappointment anyone. I couldn't put the book down the moment I start reading. It was great!!!</td></tr><tr><td>I grew up with Travers's series and was pleased to find them offered in hardcover. I purchased a set for me and my grandchildren. I have enjoyed re-reading the works.</td></tr><tr><td>Good book</td></tr><tr><td>All of Shel Silverstein's books are amazing. I don't really have to say much about that. I kept my \"Where The Sidewalk Ends\" ever since I was a little girl and I read some of the poems to my 7 year old son one night. He seemed really interested and entertained, which is saying a lot, because it's hard for me to get him to sit still most of the time (he's autistic). So, I got \"The Giving Tree\" off of his bookshelf and read that to him. He loved it. I decided to buy some more books and here we are. They were a hit. This product was in perfect condition and delivered to me unharmed. I'm pleased.</td></tr><tr><td>Second time reading it. I still like the Tv series better. Elena is nicer and more compassionate in the show</td></tr><tr><td>Very enjoyable read.  Moist is a superb character, and the plot, rebuilding of the Post Office service and competition against \"The Grand Trunk\", is a work of genius.  Great humour, great characters and great fun.</td></tr><tr><td>This seems to me to be a rehash of old and tired aphorisms. Maybe I am too pessimistic, but this book did not help me.</td></tr><tr><td>I was not impressed with this book. I managed to read about 3 or 4 chapters and deleted it from my kindle fire. It was so boring I could not go on. Plus all the character seemd to do is complain about her life . Not for me..</td></tr><tr><td>Very good</td></tr><tr><td>This was a gift for our son, a retired Navy Captain, who is writing a Navy action novel.  I read this book many years ago and yet still remembered the authour's  vivid descriptions of the weather in the North Sea and of general life on the ships, to introduce him to how a brilliant writer can picture up life on board ships at war.</td></tr><tr><td>again fun reading</td></tr><tr><td>I couldn't put it down  The dog is the narrator  I cried at times and smiled and laughed at other times. This is my best book EVER</td></tr><tr><td>The most interesting aspect about books such as these (and their writers) is the numbing ease with which they distort and ignore  the facts in order to give the appearance of being scholarly, thorough, and fair.  Ms. Charen is none of these, as her title implies to any of her readers. She is simply one more person--I should say journalist--who has strayed into an area about which she has little or no insight.  Her pretensions to the contrary--and what pretensions--are laughable as is her thesis about Central America and the United States' involvement in its horrible history (read Chomsky for an understanding of what we have been doing there for the last 25 years).  Indeed, so much about the world is taken for granted that it finally begins to act as backround cliche; most intelligent people will automatically sense that and pass on this sorry tome to Reaganism and its pathetic balderdash.  The rest of you will just have to decide on your own about whether to read this book, which begins with a journalistic account of the late 20th Century collapse of the Soviet Empire--\"like the dominoes the West had once feared in Southeast Asia\"--before moving on (briefly) to the bewilderment that those in power felt when their world disappeared at the end of the Cold War.  The implications here are many and interesting but they completely escaped Ms. Charen (as did the opportunity to write an interesting and valuable book) because she wastes no time analyzing them in order to go after instead \"Liberal opinion makers in America\".  She even suggests (and this is what is offensive) that it is wrong and, need I add, Liberal, to see no victor at all in the Cold War, but she can not say why it's wrong, naive or whatever, only imply it by the tone and her selection of strawmen to demolish, such as the hapless Gorbachev.  This last point of hers, the linking of liberals to Gorbachev, is both fascinating and at the same time strangely repellant, like the world of tabloid television with its carnival mentality and aura of threatened violence.  But enough of reasons.  You'll already know in advance if this is the sort of book you should read if you happen to be one of the many people (and there are many) who still feel that Reagan was a Great President.  If you are then Ms. Charen is certainly a writer for you: ever ready to ferry you across the Stygian river to her Amerika.  All aboard!  The trip is short at least.</td></tr><tr><td>I am a big Sanford fan but this was my least favorite book in his Prey series.  If this is the only one you have ever read pleas read another in the series because if you like murder mysteries you will be missing out on a great series.  This is the only book in the series that I did not read in two days or less.</td></tr><tr><td>Having watched the series religiously, it seemed natural to order the set, to see what was left out, already I have a better view of things, like who is Jon Snow's mother was although still a mystery it is intriguing ...And other goodies</td></tr><tr><td>Another well written saga from Jules. Her settings and her well developed characters make for great reading.</td></tr><tr><td>A classic that will be around forever</td></tr><tr><td>Good for the Soul</td></tr><tr><td>Eric Blehm is a marvelous and immensely talented writer. He lays out the background story of The Only thing Worth Dying For in the beginning chapters, quickly running through a huge number of people's names and military jargon. Blehm's talents are many and difficult to describe in a review - much better to read in person. But #1 amongst his talent is Blehm's ability to concisely interpret interviews and reports into a coherent whole. His depiction of events involving evaluation of wounded soldiers is graphic and real. Blehm is a researcher who digs deeply into his subject, reading and interviewing and tracking every bit of information to its source. Another of Blehm's talents for those of us without a military background is the way he takes military jargon and reduces it to just the important concepts. He also succeeds in helping readers follow the ever-expanding cast of characters. Nothing in Blehm's writing is extraneous. Nothing is wasted. The best part of The Only Thing Worth Fighting For is that, though written in the genre of creative non-fiction, Blehm is scrupulous in keeping himself out of the story. He lets the ODA team, and what happened to them in Southern Afganistan, stay front and center throughout the book. Eric Blehm is writer we should keep an eye on. He is young, though experienced. He is talented. His next project will be greeted with much anticipation. I'm sure it will be as great as The Last Season and The Only Thing Worth Fighting For.</td></tr><tr><td>Olld classic. Retread to see where he came from</td></tr><tr><td>I really enjoyed this book.  It is extremely well written and quite frightening.  The style of writing (in the form of letters from the wife to her husband) is unusual but did not detract from the story or the subject.</td></tr><tr><td>Good read with an interwoven plot. To much tactical information for us none military types.</td></tr><tr><td>Only surprise is how small the book is. It is about 3\"x4\". Not bad, but not what I was expecting -- however this is totally my fault as the product's page has an illustration of how small it is and the dimensions. If you are an outdoorsy person, this sized book may be perfect to keep in your backpack or car. That way, it is conveniently stowed away for any unexpected situation.</td></tr><tr><td>It was a happy day when this book was available for purchase on Kindle.  I'm a big fan of the series and enjoy all the characters immensely.  This story was excellent and I couldn't put the book down.</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks for  excellent service  and  products (book and cd).  Since I ordered this as a gift to a young child, the condition was important.</td></tr><tr><td>Okay, so this book is about an unfaithful husband and a broken marriage.  If either of these topics are off limits to you..pass this book up.  If you're like me, the premise was a bit intriguing. I love books that are about second chances. The idea that no matter how \"messed up\" a person or a situation is...there can be healing and restoration.  This book taps into that premise. John Hammond and his wife Viola have been estranged for many years.  Living separate lives, both have consummed themselves with different things.  Viola with friends and community projects...John with wine and women.  He has admittedly had several mistresses.  After a tragic accident, it becomes necessary for John to reconcile with Viola so that he can ensure an heir.  He begins the painful process of courting his angry and bitter wife. This book is funny, touching, painful, and very sweet.  I loved John and Viola's courtship.  The scene where they have the question and answer session with \"brutal honesty\" was so heart wrenching, but necessary for this couple to move forward.  The museum, pond, and picnic scenes were all memorable, fun, and believable. I don't hesitate to recommend this book.</td></tr><tr><td>Easily the worst of the series so far, but still entertaining to a point. You get more insight and backstory from characters that you haven't really seen much of, as well as getting to see some seldom explored locations. Not a lot happens, but it has its moments.</td></tr><tr><td>Sena Jeter Naslund's novels \"Ahab's Wife\" and \"Four Spirits\" are among the favorites in my book collection.  In her newest novel, \"Abundance,\" Naslund does not disappoint.  Told from the point of view of Marie Antoinette, wife to King Louis XVI, this novel paints a sympathetic portrait of this historical figure and takes us into the inner workings of her mind as Naslund imagines them.  From a child of 14 on her wedding day to the public beheading by guillotine, we experience Marie Antoinette's journey into royal life and the personal journey she undergoes along the way.  Naslund's greatest writing talents are all present in this novel; her ability to make the reader feel as if (s)he knows the main character intimately, her beautiful, poetic turns of phrase, her use of foreshadowing to instill a sense of dread in the reader as tragedy nears.  In this case, because it is based on historical events, we the readers know the final outcome of Marie Antoinette and her family; however, Naslund embodies the character of Antoinette so well that despite our knowledge of her demise we find ourselves desperate with hope for her as her end draws near.  In fact, Naslund creates this main character so well that she literally becomes Marie Antoinette's voice - it is hard sometimes to remember that this book is historical fiction, not a memoir, so well does Naslund transform her voice into that of the queen's.  Through her embodiment of Marie Antoinette we fall deeply in love with the queen and live every moment of her journey with her, left stricken and heart-broken at the end of the book when we finally lose her.  Naslund has a knack for enchanting the reader with her strong, independent-minded, lovably unique main characters, and this book is no exception; despite her flaws, the reader is left to root for Marie Antoinette and to understand why her dearest and most loyal friends would have literally laid down their lives for her.</td></tr><tr><td>I really love this author. I've read all his books however, way too much highly negative political statements against our president. So unnecessary.</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great aid to assist you in understanding how your body works, what it needs, and the impact of what you put in your body and how that affects your health. Great book for those who have come to realize they have to take care of their body to live well.</td></tr><tr><td>Loved this book - the high quality of writing and research set in  the first two books of this series continues in quality - I'd recommend it for anyone from junior high age up.  A great read!  Now I am waiting anxiously for the next book.</td></tr><tr><td>My wife Anne bought me this book for our 20th anniversary trip to Las Vegas last year. She said it would help us get about and find our way round. After reading the first chapter I was no nearer finding out anything about Las Vegas or its popular attractions. I did find it quite entertaining nether the less, however I do suspect the young men depicted herein did occasionally use substances which I am not accustomed with. Anyway on a separate note, my wife's arms temporarily cleared up whilst over in the U.S of A (America, or 'The States' as we Brits call it). My wife's arms have become increasing hairy over the years, especially around a large birthmark on her left forearm, here the hair resembles that of a wooly mammoth. When we met 22 years ago she looked normal.</td></tr><tr><td>The 18th story in the life of J.P. Beaumont. Justice Denied is a story with some back story written in. While working for the State Attorney General on special assignment, Beau finds himself learning more of the past life of Ann Corley, his second wife who had a mysterious past and violent end. If you haven't read the other books, you can jump in and get some of the back story. I started with the first book and have tried to read each in order.</td></tr><tr><td>The book was excellent, so I'll be reading the rest of the series.</td></tr><tr><td>I love the Bridgerton series.  But any other book written by Julia Quinn seems boring.  This book was sweet, the hero and heroine nice.  But that is all.  Nothing exciting, nothing interesting, nothing new.  And the scene where they declare their love and then became intimate was ridiculous.  Upstairs, in the middle of a party, right after her concert.  Really??</td></tr><tr><td>It took me forever to get through this book. Several times I just sat it down refusing to reopen it, but I hate not finishing a book. I literally FORCED myself to finish it. I wouldn't even recommend you check this one out at the library...</td></tr><tr><td>Beautifully crafted over 10 years of writing... Read slow & savor...</td></tr><tr><td>My 7th time reading LOTR start to finish, still an engaging and interesting tale, even when you know what comes next.</td></tr><tr><td>If you purchased this book before the election, but haven't read it yet, I would suggest you do so.  Although the editing could use a bit of work, much of the information presented in this book will be useful as we move into a new era.  Incredibly, Morris presented a clear view of what he thought would happen in the economy when it became clear that Obama would win the election - in my opinion, he was pretty much on target.  He describes in detail just how little work our elected officials actually do in Washington (think in terms of days, not weeks).  Morris also makes a good case for why the Bush approach to addressing terrorism makes a lot more sense than the \"head in the sand\" positions of many in the media and on the left. Dick Morris knows his stuff.  This book is not a quick & easy read, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for detail, detail, detail on why and how we're being fleeced.</td></tr><tr><td>Great read.  Easy to follow.  Excellent writing and character development.  One can easily understand how Stone Barrington became the foundation corner stone of the series from reading the earlier works.</td></tr><tr><td>This is the 4th Harry Hole book I read and it was my favorite so far - I really enjoyed the setting (Oslo and northern Europe) and the way the narrative switched between the World War Two days and today. The storyline was a bit more complex than the others, with a deeper historical, political context which added a lot to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Oliver North has written another installment in his series of military action books that is a big hit. Kudos and I am looking forward to the next one.</td></tr><tr><td>I would have liked more photos, but the story is very good.  I was a teenager when she reached the top.</td></tr><tr><td>I've read a number of J.A. Jance's mysteries and enjoyed them, but I had to push myself to finish this book. There's not a lot of mystery involved -- the killer is identified early on -- so the reader is left with following a rather confusing set of characters, both Indian and Anglo, and how they wind up interacting with each other. Some of their names are similar, which makes it even more confusing. The story idea was good, but the execution wasn't as good as it could have been -- not up to Jance's usual standard. It jumps back and forth frequently between the voices of different characters. This is a stand-alone book -- not one of the Joanna Brady or J.P. Beaumont mystery series -- but that didn't bother me. I found the information about the night-blooming cereus flowers interesting and went online to see photos of the blooms. But the story just didn't grab me. Not one of Jance's better efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>Great read and not an expensive book.</td></tr><tr><td>D.E. Stevenson is one of my favorite authors and Vittoria Cottage has become one of my favorites of her books.  This book has sequels to it as well, Music in the Hills and Shoulder the Sky.</td></tr><tr><td>\"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story Of The Scott Peterson Investigation,\" by multi-talented former judge/news reporter/turned writer, Catherine Crier, is a well-researched, well-written, look inside the \"real-life\" of Scott Peterson...\"the man\" ...the \"monster.\" Crier breaks the legal mumbo-jumbo down in \"layman terms,\" so it is easy to understand. Inside the courtroom coverage and a look behind the courtroom scenes make this book an exciting page-turner to be sure. BRAVA Ms. Crier on a job well-done! If you are a person who enjoys books of this intriguing genre then you should order your copy of, \"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story Of The Scott Peterson Investigation from Amazon.com, today!  You'll be glad you did.  This book makes for great conversation. (Highly Recommend!)</td></tr><tr><td>it is a nice easy to read Author and has some good yarns about Peter and rina and family I enjoy Faye kellerman Decker books</td></tr><tr><td>This book was fantastic.  I enjoyed every page.  I was surprised to find that the book was believable!  I found the characters to have been painted so vividly that you really feel a connection.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is rare to find a piece of historical fiction that is likeable to as large a group of readers as I feel this piece to be.  It is perfect without dwelling too much on details like the time, geography, etc.  This book is really a colorful telling of the tapestries and the story itself is almost as fascinating as the tapestries themselves!</td></tr><tr><td>Well written and very straight forward. I gained a lot of insight as to what actually happened in North Korea</td></tr><tr><td>This book should be a MUST READ for anyone who has the slightest interest in who Jesus is and what he means to you.  The book takes you beyond the beliefs and teachings of the Christian community through history to the present day and shows you why you to can be a \"Christian\" even though you do not believe in any Christian Religion.  This book shows why modern day religious organizations must change before they die out completely.  Was Jesus \"God made man\" or \"Man made God\"?  What is the meaning of \"Salvation\"?  How can all people live life more abundantly?  These questions and more are addressed.  I couldn't put this book down and I do not think you will be able to either.</td></tr><tr><td>The Obsidian Key written by Eldon Thompson is an action packed fantasy novel that is sure to keep you enthralled. Following the now King Torin on his adventure to rediscover a people that had been rumored to no longer exist many years ago, you are in for a wild ride. After his retrieval of the Crimson Sword in book one of The Legend of Asahiel series, Torin has accidently unleashed a horror that had been locked away and is now rising to wreak havoc on his world. When a robed figure appears in Torin's room looking of death itself, he learns there is a new adventure laying in wait for him. He must do his part to right the world, and with the help of a renegade Entinent, his betrothed's father. This task however will not be easy, especially with spies around each and every corner; some are even his own men...one in particular seeks to have the crown for himself. With a shocking and totally unforeseen ending, The Obsidian Key is phenomenal! Mr. Thompson has a way with words and with them, he paints a picture before the reader. Usually not much into fantasies, I have to say this is one of the best I have read, I look forward to book three of The Legend of Asahiel Series! 4.5 Hearts</td></tr><tr><td>Dracula was written a century ago, and it would be difficult to find someone who doesn't know of the books prominence.  Having said that, my review is tailored to this edition of the classic.  I chose this edition because it's not annotated and its not abridged, meaning you see the text as it was originally written by Bram Stoker. The Books construction is of high quality material, the paper is thick ivory, and it includes a built in ribbon place mark.  The typography is classy as well as easy on the eyes.  I was also surprised by the illustrations included in the book, which were done by Scott McKowen.  The illustrations are appropriately placed, and no so numerous to make you think you're reading a children's edition. I haven't detected any spelling or obvious grammatical errors either.  While the book isn't laden with annotations, the publisher was kind enough to occasionally include definitions in the footnotes of various pages.  This is very helpful and greatly reduces the need to search for an Old English/Scottish dictionary.  However, to minimize the effect, the publisher doesn't do this too often and it's easily overlooked. Overall, I'm immensely impressed with both the quality of this edition and the price, which makes it a steal.  Out of the numerous editions I've read from public libraries, this is by far the best I've seen.  At less than $10, there's no reason not to own this beautiful print of Bram Stokers classic. EDIT: If you're willing to spend an extra $10, the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classic's edition of Dracula is the most beautiful print of Dracula currently in production.  If you're on a budget, the $9.99 Sterling Classics edition is a great choice, but if you want something that will attract you to your book shelf then head on over to bn.com and check out the Leatherbound Classic edition.</td></tr><tr><td>Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a place for these types of stories - Ellora's Cave ebooks, Red Sage's Secrets anthologies, Harlequin Blaze.  But a trade paperback?  I don't think so. Erin Shay is thrilled to have just gotten a promotion at the lab at which she works.  She's also acquired a new partner, hunky Kale Alexander, a temporary transfer from the California office.  While she's determined to throw herself into her new job, Kale poses a huge distraction.  Having been burned by an unfaithful former boyfriend, she's gun shy of relationships.  But what's wrong with a little harmless, casual sex for once in her life?  Surely a player like Kale would be the last one to want anything more. Kale Alexander is on probation after an incident at his own lab and is being given a chance to prove himself at the lab in his Iowa hometown.  He hasn't been back in years but lately has been missing his mom and sisters.  He's been feeling restless with his empty personal life and the rather shallow women he sees in Cali.  But when he meets Erin, he falls hard.  Could he be ready to settle down - with a woman who claims to only want casual sex? Okay, from here we get almost non-stop mental lusting and several encounters that fall short of actual intercourse - many of which happen in the workplace.  Call me crazy, but isn't he on probation and isn't she also, in a way, with her new job?  Perhaps I'm too logical, but this all seemed too far fetched, too \"Cinemax After Dark\" for me.  There is a minor subplot about a jealous co-worker who tapes them \"going at it\" (at work, of course) and threatens the couple with exposure, but it's secondary to all the lusting going on.  And if that's what you're looking for this is for you. If this were a short story in an anthology or an ebook I'd feel less ripped-off.  But, contrary to the page count listed above (224) the actual story is a paltry 194 pages long.  Luckily I bought this with a gift card, so I didn't shell out the trade paperback price.  If others choose to, so be it, but for my part I say shame on Avon for publishing a short story and charging $14.00 for it - $17.50 Canadian!</td></tr><tr><td>Read this book. A fast paced compelling story with great characters transforms into the most moving fiction I've read in 10 years. Quotes from this book feel permanently lodged in my head and my outlook is deeply changed. Not just about gaming, \"For The Win\" focuses on courage, solidarity and fairness. This book is a timely myth for the world of the arab spring, the occupy movement and Otpur! This is the best book I've read all year long and I cannot recommend it more highly.</td></tr><tr><td>I thought this was an extremely honest memoir about a woman living with bipolar disorder.  She accomplished so much despite this disorder: graduating law school, passing the bar, becoming a successful entertainment lawyer and finally a published author.  But the course was anything but smooth. The book is written in an episodic manner not in a linear fashion. Events are out of sequence.  I didn't mind this although I would have liked a time-line in the back so I could piece it together.  I finished it in one night.</td></tr><tr><td>I've read this book maybe five or six times now. Each time I can't help but respect the craftsmanship. Unlike with many other books, you don't start seeing more flaws the more you read it, you just realize with each and every read how quietly good the writing is. It's a master class in writing.</td></tr><tr><td>Bram Stoker's classic Gothic novel \"Dracula\" needs no introduction. There's something timeless about this tale of vampires and the damned, of faithful love and duty, and of the eternal battle between the forces of good and evil. I have re-read \"Dracula\" numerous times since I first acquainted myself with the novel in my early teens and have enjoyed collecting different editions of this classic tale of the macabre. This 1965 Heritage Press edition has a beautiful marbled slipcover and a cloth and board cover for the book. The edition I purchased comes with the prized Sandglass pamphlets (many of these Heritage Press books have sadly lost their Sandglass pamphlets due to loss, damage, etc. over time, but many carefully-preserved editions still have these informative inserts). There's an introduction by Anthony Boucher and wood engravings illustrations by Felix Hoffmann. It's a wonderful edition that now takes pride of place among my other \"Dracula\" editions.</td></tr><tr><td>A history of mankind, from the earliest hominids through to our evolution into near science fiction. Beautifully written, easy to read, intelligently argued. Both sides of the debate are provided when something is controversial. This wonderful book ranges through the development of our early paleolithic ancestors, why sapiens eventually dominated, how settlements and then cities came about, human conflict, and the historical evolution of where we are today. There is also some sage advice on where we are going. Five and a half stars!</td></tr><tr><td>A great classic.</td></tr><tr><td>Chloe Saunders life changes from one second to another when she sees a ghost at her high school and get's a panic attack because of it. Because of this incident Chloe is sent to Lyle House, a special home for troubled teens, where she is told that she has schizophrenia. But Chloe soon begins to question the diagnosis because weird things are going on in Lyle House. She realizes that all of the teens there are special in a supernatural way and that the adults that work at Lyle House can't be trusted. Will Chloe be able to discover what's going on with her and will she be able to get out of Lyle House before it's too late? I bought \"The Summoning\" spontaneously when I saw a good deal for it at a bookstore and it was the first book I ever read by Kelley Armstrong. Before starting the book I didn't know a lot about the story and expected a light-hearted book with some paranormal elements - I couldn't have been more wrong. The book has paranormal elements but it's definitely not light-hearted. The longer I read the darker and more complicated the story got, towards the end I wasn't sure whom Chloe could trust and what would happen with her. However I was definitely not disappointed that the story was different from what I expected. In contrary, I loved the story, the characters and even the cliffhanger at the end of the book. I enjoyed everything I learned of Chloe. Reading about her struggle with the new developments in her life was fascinating and I admired that she never gave up. She is intelligent, quiet and all in all a pretty normal teenager. She cares about what happens to others and I can't wait to learn more about her, her abilities and her future. I also enjoyed that even though there is the possibility of a relationship between a boy and Chloe, that's not the main focus of the story. This relationship will have more time to develop slowly in the next two books and that's something I like. At the end of \"The Summoning\" it's unclear what Lyle House really is and the reader can only speculate about what happened there in the past. But one thing is sure, if a teenager doesn't act as he /she is supposed to, then it can end deadly. The book ends with a cliffhanger and even though I normally hate these, this time it fit to the story and I'm excited to learn what will happen next. I will definitely go on with reading this mesmerizing series, Kelley Armstrong has a new fan. cover I like the cover, it's pretty and looks a bit mysterious. final appraisal Kelley Armstrong has created a thrilling story that makes me want to read the two other books in the Darkest Powers series as soon as possible. Don't expect a light paranormal story, get ready to be amazed by a dark, complicated world. I would recommend this book to all readers (adult and young adult) who enjoy stories with paranormal elements. Darkest Powers series 1. The Summoning (2008) 2. The Awakening (2009) 3. The Reckoning (2010)</td></tr><tr><td>A classic.</td></tr><tr><td>Didn't anyone think the ending of this book was downright depressing?  Not to give anything away but really, I just couldn't believe it...I was stunned by what happened. The book was a fair read and some of the writing was quite good. I thought there were some really interesting and beautiful passages and I liked that the author gave the dogs a \"voice\" but in general, it was a loooong story with a terrible (to me) ending.</td></tr><tr><td>Fast shipping great book/author and price</td></tr><tr><td>What is wrong these days that books are classified romances when they have nothing to do with romance. Romance is a genre. AS a romance reader I have enough of having books that are not romances classified as romances.  This book is far from a romance , some of the graphic scene and cheating disgusted me. Maybe this book belong to woman fiction but as a romance it is a zero.</td></tr><tr><td>Although this continues the story with colorful and multidimensional characters, there are so many that it is difficult to keep up with some of the Lord's and ladies, knights, and commoners and who they 're related to. There are some awesome action sequences and plenty of violence but there are also some long spans of pages with lengthy descriptions but little excitement. I have to say that Martin has killed off my favorite characters and allowed a little too much injustice for a little too long..........</td></tr><tr><td>Close to the Bone would have to be my favourite Logan McCrae novel I have read to date, mainly because it is more about the personal lives of the police officers than previous instalments. Also, for the first time I hated Logan because of something he does in this book, but I then felt so sorry for him a couple of chapters later, so manipulative of my delicate emotions. I did miss Logans reporter friend and I felt like the situation with a certain someone was left unresolved, but hopefully that will be reconciled in the next novel? Also, I cried like a baby at the conclusion of this novel, which is not something I do with every crime novel I read.</td></tr><tr><td>This one book is my all time favorite book. I first received it when I was 14 and have read it over and over. I fall in love with it each and every time.</td></tr><tr><td>Excellently written and involving, this is an intimate look into a pretty screwed-up family.  The story hops from one member's view to the other, providing different ideas of the same situations.</td></tr><tr><td>then I'd be able to make and eat all this fabulous food! I did like this book very much, but for the average working person, most of the recipies seem too complicated.  I did enjoy reading the book and the photo's are beautiful. I did try the Cinnamon Banana Shake pg 83 (using Pacific Almond Milk though) and it was a very delicious shake!  I do hope to try a few of the easier recipies in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>I have been a fan of Cathy Glass for a very long time.  I have read everyone of her books and love her writing style.  This book was one of fiction while most of her others are true stories about her experiences with foster caring.  I enjoyed this book just as much as the others.  It kept me interested all the way to the end.  I've read ALL of her books now, so I will be eagerly awaiting her next.</td></tr><tr><td>If he was just going to come out and say, hey Christians, live this way and do this, I wouldn't bother reading it honestly. To put this in the form of a demon telling a younger demon how to better send souls to hell, it makes it VERY interesting. Well written, Marvel makes a comic of it even lol. Recommended for anyone, anytime.</td></tr><tr><td>I'll put the bottom line right at the top - If you enjoy reading true crime, In Broad Daylight will not disappoint you. Now, if you're interested, I'll tell you my opinion of the book. Harry N. MacLean put together an obviously well-researched account of the events leading up to, and surrounding the death of Ken McElroy. I have to say, I have the e-book which is riddled with typos and major formatting errors. It honestly looks like it was type-set by a beginning publishing student. But that's the publisher's fault, and not the writer's. I wanted the e-version because it has an epilogue to the epilogue which updates the story after 25 years. For me, it was worth wading through the horrendous formatting for that update, because my voyeuristic tendencies make me wonder about the long-term aftermath of something like this. For the most part, MacLean's narrative reads factually, but at times does feel a little like gossip passed over the neighbor's fence. He's an attorney, so I'll leave it to you to decide if that lends more or less credibility to his style. There are places where he breaks into long detailed description of the weather, land, wild life and crops. The exposition is lovely and evocative, but completely extraneous. When you see a weather or crop report coming on, you can scan until you see the name of a person or place and pick up reading from there without missing anything relevant. The case itself is a fascinating one. It's a very interesting study of the psychology of a bully and his victims. You don't have to be a true crime fan to see the significance of the story or to appreciate the book.</td></tr><tr><td>Another huge success from an author who knows how to get her readers under her spell.  A must read from the Rena Lazarus and Peter Drcker series.</td></tr><tr><td>There is no doubt about it, Richard Holmes was a splendid writer and has written a splendid book. Having read some works on the Napoleonic Wars I was unprepared to have the preconcieved nuances of my views on Wellington to be quite so challenged. I had carried the simplistic and certainly conventional thought that the Duke was really just an rather efficient logistician, who fought his war largely by calculating the odds and through exceptional organisation -  all rather dull. At a personal level, it wasn't so much his affairs but the offhand treatment of his wife which one found a little challenging. Finally, reading about his political life, I had also found his \"high\" Tory views somewhat constricted. In short, I thought him a very able general, although a somewhat unlikeable individual. However, in 300 or so pages, Mr. Holmes has caused me to go back to my book shelves once again and reconsider my somewhat naive views. There are a number of thoughts I took away from this book, but perhaps the most worthy of consideration may be the following: 1) Wellington clearly was more than a great general in the context of the Penisular; He has to be considered a great general for the ages. It is said that he was a defensive, unimaginative and somewhat uninspirational leader - none of this can be true in the context of his outstanding military achievements in both India and the Penisular. Mr. Holmes does well to bring out the strengths which made him the genius he was and hopefully this goes some way to correcting two centuries of negative propaganda around his generalship. I particularly like Mr. Holmes' even-handed approach when dealing with controversies, particularly Badajoz (where it seems apparent he lost control of his troops) and Waterloo (where he was conflicted with national imperatives and the need to support his allies). 2) Touching on his personal life, I am glad Mr. Holmes did not feel the need to go into prurient details, but it was evident that Wellington had an unhappy marriage. How he coped with this seems to have at least involved discretion but what I think brought his humanity to the fore was his observations following his wife's death. Sadly, it also seems clear that his relationships with his children seemed somewhat poor - perhaps, to paraphrase Douro, because they all hard a terrifically hard act to follow. Beyond his family though, there does seem to be strong evidence that he was in fact warm hearted and generous behind the public facade. 3) As to his politics he comes across as man of the times working in a framework of principles, but at least did have the flexibility of mind to shift his position on various issues. His political career was not stellar in any real sense, but I think it hard to see his goverment service as anything but a good man trying, by his lights, to do what was right for the country and his monarch. In short, no review of mine can do justice to this excellent biography, but I just would have liked to thank Mr. Holmes for vividly showing the Duke to be a much more complex, gifited, humane, interesting and, (dare I say it since Holmes himself may not have agreed), likeable man than I had previously understood to be the case.</td></tr><tr><td>I liked it because it did not get graphic about the abuse.  It centered on the affects it had on her</td></tr><tr><td>I have to admit that by the time I finished The Queen of Babble, I was more than a little disappointed with it. Sure, I read it with some sense of enthusiasm, because it's a quick, easy, and light read, as I knew it would be, but overall I just didn't feel very invested in this book. There was no need to keep reading to see what would happen -- I pretty much knew exactly how it would end from at least a third of the way in -- but I did want to keep reading to see just exactly what \"situations\" Lizzie would get herself into. However, putting the silly-but-readable plot aside for a moment, the book was flawed from the very beginning for me. As a main character, Lizzie didn't seem to have very many redeeming qualities - if any? She very much lacks a backbone and she quite apparently lacks some respect for herself and, due to such, she certainly didn't garner any respect from me. She was too nave for her own good and at a lot of times her actions were downright annoying. At many times, I wanted to smack Lizzie's character through the pages (though a difficult task it would be) for her silliness, especially her actions regarding her boyfriend Andrew and her actions that led to her not having graduated college. Her bad relationship decisions in many ways reminded me, very unfortunately, of the times I watched some of my friends make the same silly decisions for people who definitely weren't worth it. And it's hard enough to take in real life; I hardly want to read a book with a character that constantly puts herself in similar situations. At times I seriously wondered why the other characters in the book would even continue to put up with her annoying behavior. Quite honestly, I probably only kept reading because Luke seemed dreamy, as did the idea of the chateau in general, and the interaction between Chaz and Shari seemed more believable and enjoyable to me than Lizzie's interactions with any other character or, quite frankly, even with herself. I have to pause because I don't mean to completely tear down this book. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.  I was merely a little confused because I have (almost) always enjoyed Meg Cabot's other books. However, it seems to me that she has gotten further and further from the original stories of hers that I so loved - Boy Meets Girl and The Boy Next Door. The Size 12/Size 14 books deviated from that format, but I at least still found the mysteries to be drawing enough to enjoy.  However, this most recent book seems to have crossed a little over the line into the category of silly, and that's what I find to be disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>One of my all-time favorites. One of the first SF books I read as a kid. If you know a youngster who loves science, give them this book. I haven't read it recently, so I can't recommend a reading level, but I guess I must have been about 12 when I read it first. Guess I need to read it again soon!</td></tr><tr><td>I guess I'm in the minority here.  I thought the book read like ' Bridget Jones' meets Nora Ephron et al, but in a superficial way.  You know exactly where this fluffy piece of mind candy is going before you finish page one.</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful read! Depicts an era of a society filled with propertied titled people with lots of time on their hands. Filled with humor</td></tr><tr><td>How does she keep creating these wonderfully real characters? They are quirky and funny. Sometimes they break your heart. I just want to keep reading more and more.</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this with the intention of the books having the original drawings. They don't.</td></tr><tr><td>I love this book. I have read it many times over the years and each time I get something new from it. The book is told from Joes POV and the reader is carried along with him as he learns about his father, his past and ultimately about himself. At the start of the book he has a blind, total love for his father and by the end he still loves his father but has a much greater understanding of him as a man and as a consequence a greater understanding of himself. I loved Joes awkwardness, his vulnerabilities and his intelligence. It goes without saying that the writing is excellent and the story-telling is fantastic, but what stays longest with me is Joe, who may be quiet but is not silent by any means.</td></tr><tr><td>Very good, the last in her series of 7.</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone who's done any reading on goal-setting and acquiring your desires knows that you need to KNOW what you want.  And some people may even know about the idea of a \"vision board\" .  But this book is a wonderful centerpiece for any conversation on the topic.  You'll not only learn why you should have one but how to create a POWERFUL one so you can start attracting more of what you want in life and less of what you don't want.  Great stuff!</td></tr><tr><td>This book started fairly slowly for me...I wasn't sure if I bought in to the lead character, but the plot was intriguing.  As I read more, the awkward dialogue, I discovered, was intentional...as the biologist was awkward, highly empirical and intentional herself.  The more I read, the more invested I became in her story.  It was haunting, weird, beautiful.  Great writing.  By the end, I was greatly affected by this book.  I will continue with the trilogy.</td></tr><tr><td>Kim Harrison is a must read!!!  Her books are witty funny & her characters come to life.

is a stand alone by the author. Detective Constable Callum MacGregor of the Scotland Police is a character that reminds me of Job in the bible. Every bad thing that you can imagine happens to him. He is assigned to a \"misfit squad\" because management believes that he took a bribe by ruining crime evidence and causing a major criminal to go free. In fact, it was his pregnant girlfriend, who is a crime scene technician. His squad is assigned what looks like a joke-- investigating a mummy found in a garbage dump. This is a very long book, 604p. It held my interest with some false leads, as the team gradually realize that they are dealing with a serial killer. There is a humorous side to the book as some weird dietary habits are mentioned--raspberry jam on anchovy pizza?! I think the book was a little too long. The characters were believable and plot led up to a satisfactory ending. Another character that I liked was Rosalind Franklin, an attractive black woman, sent to the misfit squad after she punched a Superintendent who grabbed her bottom. Some quotes by Callum: \"Why did no one ever come back when they were told to? Anyone would think that people didn't want to get arrested.\" \"Poor sod. Living with Franklin must be like trying to cross a minefield on a pogo stick every day. Blindfold. While sadists threw burning squirrels at you.\" Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher, HarperCollins for sending me this book.</td><td>Well written, but long, Scottish police procedural</td><td>0</td><td>2017-09-07</td><td>List(List(document, 0, 1446, 3.5 stars This is a stand alone by the author.

Now I wish I read it sooner. I loved it! Once I started, I was hooked and could not put it down. Granted this book is not for everyone. The slang could be off-putting but it worked perfectly for this book. The story is narrated by an uneducated, feral girl named Elka. She was just seven years old, wandering lost and hungry in the wilderness, when a solitary hunter took her in. Never knowing his name, she called him Trapper. For ten years he taught her how to hunt, shoot, set snares and start fires, everything she needed to survive. Everything changes when she goes to town and sees a Wanted Poster with his picture. She decides to escape his clutches and sets out on a long journey in the hope of finding her long-lost parents. But as the trail of blood and bodies grows in her path, Elka realizes that daddy won't be letting his little girl go without a fight. This book can be dark and I highly recommend it if you like a post-apocalyptic suspense story.

of this World Reviews</td><td>Fool's Assassin by Robin Hobb is the first novel in Hobb's Fitz and the Fool series, her latest to tell the ongoing story of her beloved character, FitzChivalry Farseer. Hobb began Fitz's journey many books and series ago when the character was a child. All throughout, Fitz has built relationships, made enemies, served his king, loved and lost, and, above all, made nearly every sacrifice imaginable. It's been a long, hard road for the bastard son of Chivalry Farseer, but one that I can say with great relief isn't over yet. Fool's Assassin picks up not terribly long after Fool's Fate. Fitz has settled into his persona as Tom Badgerlock, holder for the lands of his daughter, Nettle. Because of his past (and everyone thinking he's dead), Fitz must maintain this false identity for his own good and the good of the Farseers. Far from being resentful of it, Fitz has embraced the life of a holder since it keeps him far from the court intrigue and politics so prevalent in Buckkeep Castle. Even better, Fitz has been reunited with the love of his life, Molly, who now resides with him at Withywoods, where they lead an idyllic life. It would seem Fitz, who has sacrificed so much, has finally earned the quiet life he has wanted for so long. That, in fact, how we find Fitz and Molly getting on for nearly the first half of the book. True to the author's style, Hobb moves us along very slowly. Longtime fans will not be surprised by this at all. It's a testament to Hobb's skill as a writer, though, that even sans many of the plot devices other authors dangle in front of readers to keep their attention, she is able to maintain the reader's interest over hundreds of pages while slowly doling out bits and pieces of the larger story to come. When the end of this first novel in the Fitz and Fool trilogy does come, it comes fast. It left me deeply interested in what's to come next for Fitz as he is finally reunited with his longtime friend, the Fool. I will freely admit bias when reviewing anything penned by Robin Hobb as she has long been a favorite author of mine. Not that I've embraced everything she's ever written, but I, like so many other readers, has been on Fitz's journey for so long that I doubt there's any story she could tell about him that I didn't find of interest. Even still, Fool's Assassin earned a rating of three rockets. I would have given it four if only Hobb had cut to the chase a bit and gotten to the real story sooner.</td><td>A preface to (hopefully) something great</td><td>0</td><td>2017-10-26</td><td>List(List(document, 0, 2459, Fool's Assassin by Robin Hobb is the first novel in Hobb's Fitz and the Fool series, her latest to tell the ongoing story of her beloved character, FitzChivalry Farseer.

James series. I chose to read this book due to recommendations from mystery readers. Duncan Kincaid is on a holiday from Scotland Yard. His cousin has offered him a stay at his time share in Yorkshire. Duncan looks forward to just relaxing and does not let fellow vacationers know his profession. That soon changes when a murder happens after Duncan checks in. The murder in not in Duncan's jurisdiction and the head local investigator resents Duncan looking in on the crime. The suspects are time share vacationers plus the management of the time share facilities. In this first introduction to Duncan, he is very capable and likable. His partner Gemma does investigation in the neighborhoods of the suspects. It was a good mystery due to all all the suspects and plotting.  I would think I had it figured out and then would change my mind that is was another suspect who committed the murders. There was a twist in the story. I am looking forward to reading more in the series and catching up with Duncan's and Gemma's lives.
